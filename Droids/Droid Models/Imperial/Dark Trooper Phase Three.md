> **Notes:** The Phase Three Dark Trooper can also be worn as an exo-suit using the powersuit operation skill. The operator can take advantage of any of the droid’s accessories, but must use his own weapon skills to operate the droid’s armament. The operator must use the droid’s Dexterity and Strength scores while using the suit, but any damage that penetrates the suit is applied to the operator’s unmodified Strength score.
