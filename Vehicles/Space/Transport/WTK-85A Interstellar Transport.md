**Background**
The WTK-85A interstellar transport was a model of transport manufactured by Sublights Products Corporation. Designed for scouts or pilots who worked with minimal crew requirements, the WTK-85A only needed one pilot, though had space for a co-pilot.

Designed for scouts and lone pilots, the ship only needed one pilot, but was demanded by safety requirements to have copilot station with a redundant controls. The massive engines that flanked the ship were a combination of sublight and hyperspace drives. The ship had a modern navicomputer which was useful for loners, and speeds that could approach a starfighter in atmosphere.
