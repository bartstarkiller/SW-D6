Type: Ssi-ruuvi hand weapon
Scale: Character
Skill: Blaster: ion beamer
Ammo: 25 shots per power cell
Availability: 4

> **Game Notes:** 
> Any character struck by the beam for stun damage, must make an opposed Strength check. If the result is stunned, the character is stunned (as per normal “stun damage” rules). If the damage roll beats the character’s Strength roll by 4 or more points, the portion of the body struck is stunned for 1-3 hours (1D/2) (roll on the hit location chart on the Rulebook). If the head or torso is struck, the target is completely immobile (although still conscious); if a limb is struck, that limb is disabled. Since the weapon was designed for the odd hand structure of the Ssi-ruuk, humans find the weapon extremely difficult to handle. All human users add +2D to the difficulty to fire the weapon. Humans with a blaster: ion beamer specialization only add +1D to the difficulty to fire the weapon.
