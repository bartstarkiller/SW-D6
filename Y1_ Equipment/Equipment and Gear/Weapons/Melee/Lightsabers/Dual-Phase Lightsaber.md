> **Game Notes:** 
> A dual-phase lightsaber has an adjustable blade length. They can be set for either standard length (130 cm) or more than double the normal length (300 cm). This doesn’t increase damage, but it does increase the reach of the wielder to 4 meters. If an attacking character **misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points** (the base difficulty; not their opponent’s parry total), the character has **injured themself** with the lightsaber. Creating a dual- phase lightsaber adds +5 to the difficulty of the lightsaber repair roll made to construct it.
