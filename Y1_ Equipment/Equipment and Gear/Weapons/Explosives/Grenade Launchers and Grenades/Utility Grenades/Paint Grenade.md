Not only would it temporarily stun those in the blast radius but everyone and everything in a 10-meter radius would be covered in a kaleidoscope of colors. Able to be magnetically attached to metal surfaces.

**Background**
Sabine Wren, a young Mandalorian weapons expert, created paint bombs or color bombs. These explosives spread clouds of paint and were used as a diversion on Lothal. Sabine planted one on a TIE fighter, causing it to explode and knock down several stormtroopers. This allowed the starship, the Ghost, to escape. The paint bombs work by filling explosives with various materials to produce different outcomes.
