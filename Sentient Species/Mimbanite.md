**Data**

## Overview

Like the Coway, Mimbanites were humanoids with short fur, but they were smaller and less robust. Their fur was green rather than red.

> What's the deal with the alcohol begging? Do the Mimban need it like biological fuel, or have they become addicted like Arcona to salt?

%%Removed the weird licking alcohol off the floor like a feral beast pictures  %%

## History

Unwilling or unable to retreat to caves deep in the swamplands like their cousins, the Coway, when the Galactic Empire set up their mining operations, Mimbanites were reduced to scavenging.
