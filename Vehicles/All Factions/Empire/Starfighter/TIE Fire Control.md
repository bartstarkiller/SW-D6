> **Note:** The TIE/fc improves the fire control of another **capital ship gunner by +2D**, or a **starfighter gunner by +1D**. The TIE/fc must make a search scan of the designated target - a **Moderate** sensors skill difficulty, modified by circumstance and the TIE/fc’s search value of 3D+2 - and be within sensor search range (80 units). Target acquisition can be dodged as if it were enemy fire. The improved fire control has no effect on the firing gun’s range. Only one target can be painted and one gun guided at a time. New targets can be acquired and different guns guided in any round, as actions.
