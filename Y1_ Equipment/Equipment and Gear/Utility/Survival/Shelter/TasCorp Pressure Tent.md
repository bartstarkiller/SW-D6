**Game Notes:** 
> A pressure tent provides a safe habitat on the surface of Tasariq. A small pressure tent uses 2 individual oxygen tanks, a medium pressure tent uses 2 vehicle oxygen tanks, a large pressure tent uses 4 vehicle oxygen tanks. The tanks provide one week of use. A pressure tent can be set up in about an hour. A small tent holds 1-3 people, a medium tent hold 6-12 people, a large tent hold 20-40 people. Pressure tents only protect the inhabitants from weather conditions, even severe storms. It provides no protection from blaster fire, explosions, or projectile or melee weapons.
