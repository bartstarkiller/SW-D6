**Wookiepedia**

## Overview

The **Vurk** were a reptilian sentient species that was native to the planet Sembla. They had green, dark green, or gray skin.   

## Biology and Appearance

They had a bony crest sitting atop their heads. The head crest was a key feature of the species and continued to grow throughout the life of the Vurk.

## Society and Culture

It was thought that the Vurk were a primitive species, but they were highly empathic and skilled mediators.

Vurks are an amphibious species from the watery world of Sembla that are considered by many to be a relatively primitive society. The truth is that they are merely very nomadic and tend not to settle in one place for long enough to develop any kind of industry or advanced technology. Sembla, which is formed of large warm seas separated by volcanic ridges that create the continents of the planet, caused the Vurks to evolve from amphibious creatures that crawled from the planet’s life-producing oceans millenia ago. Vurk commonly travel into the galaxy when they can get offworld, as their nomadic tendencies (ingrained into them on almost the genetic level) lead them to wander the stars and only occasionally return to their homeworld. 

## History



## In the Galaxy

Jedi Master Coleman Trebor was a member of this species. Another Vurk was Sweitt Concorkill, who was present at the Galaxies Opera House with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on Coruscant during the last days of the Clone Wars.
