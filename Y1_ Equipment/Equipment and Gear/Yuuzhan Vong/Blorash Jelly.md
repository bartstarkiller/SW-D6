**Game Notes:** 
Blorash jelly is an amorphous, sticky blob. When struck, a character must succeed at a **Difficult** dodge roll or be pinned and unable to move. Even if this dodge roll succeeds, the character can only move at half speed, and his Dexterity is penalized by -2D. Removing the blorash jelly requires either a V**ery Difficult** Strength roll, or a **Difficult** Knowledge roll. Alternately, either an energy weapon or a cutting weapon can be employed, but this requires a damage roll against a Strength of 3D+1 that results in a Incapacitated result or more.
