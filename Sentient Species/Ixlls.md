**Special Skills**
**Dexterity skills**
**Flight:** This is the skill Ixlls use to fly.
**Special Abilities**
**Flight:** Ixlls are capable of true flight in their home planet’s low gravity at a Move of 28 (about 80 Km/h). In regular gravity, they can glide without difficulty at a Move of 14 (about 40 Km/h).
**Sonar:** Ixlls have normal vision augmented by sonar, allowing them to fly safely at night, or when the sun is eclipsed by Da Soocha (a frequent occurrence). They suffer no penalty for movement in dark.
**Droid Programming**: Ixlls have very high pitched voices to communicate over long distances in the thin air at the top of their perches. Their language consists of chirps, clicks, and whistles. The Ixlls learned how to use their voices to communicate with R2 units and other droids that use such information dense languages (this counts as a different language).
**Story Factors**
**Friendliness:** Ixlls are quite playful and think of the New Republic officers and troops as new and interesting people to play with. They are quite pleased to have so many guests at one time and especially like the New Republic droids.
**Pranks:** There has been some minor trouble with the playful Ixlls “accidentally” reprogramming the astromech droids. Sometimes this amounts to little more than a droid screwing up a repair job. In other cases, some Ixlls have lured droids away to give as gifts to one another. The Ixlls find this quite amusing; the Republic diplomats are trying to politely resolve the matter.
