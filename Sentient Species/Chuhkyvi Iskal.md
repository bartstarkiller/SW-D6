Special Abilities
**Swimming Ability:** Iskalonians gain a bonus of +3D to their swimming skill.

**Water Breathers:** Iskalonians cannot stay out of water for more than an hour at a time, unless they employ special rebreather gear that allows them to do so.

**Poor Vision:** When out of water, Iskalonians are unable to see very well (Perception dice pools related to sight are halved). Their rebreather gear, however, compensates for this as long as it is worn.
