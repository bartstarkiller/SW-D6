**Game Notes:** 
> A properly coded master coder chip gives the user a +1 to +4D bonus to security rolls involving electronic systems (electronic code locks, palm print scanners and retinal scanners, for example; the bonus modifier depends upon the sophistication of the computer system) but failure on a security roll (or a “1” on the Wild Die roll) means that the illegal master coder has been detected by the security system, sounding an alarm.
