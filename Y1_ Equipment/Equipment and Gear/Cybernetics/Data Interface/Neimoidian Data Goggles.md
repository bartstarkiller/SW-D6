**Game Notes:** 
> This is a cybernetic implant used by Neimoidians, and is not usually installed in non-Neimoidian patients (see below). To be of use, the goggles must be properly attuned to the wearer, and linked to a ship’s computer and communications system. The goggles grant a 1D+2 bonus on all astrogation, computer programming/ repair, and appropriate spacecraft repair rolls, as well as a 3D+1 bonus on all appropriate spacecraft piloting rolls. If a successful attack disrupt the vessel’s internal communications network, the user must make a **Heroic** Strength check or be stunned for 1D+1 rounds. The price for such an installation is not only financial – the mere installation of the implant causes the pilot to lose +2 pips of both Knowledge and Perception (the loss is permanent). Neimoidian surgeons are unlikely to install this sort of hardware into non-Neimoidians without a sufficient bribe. However, since stock models of this technology is made specifically for Neimoidians, any character of another species loses twice as much Knowledge and Perception (ie, +4 pips/1D+1) due to the installation.
