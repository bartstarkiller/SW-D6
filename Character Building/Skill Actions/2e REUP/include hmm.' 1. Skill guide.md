# Overview
Using attributes and skills is easy if you follow one simple concept. It's called the "Star Wars Rule of Thumb."

Pick a difficulty number. If the character's skill roll is equal or higher, she succeeds.

When you want your character to do something, the gamemaster picks a difficulty number. (All the lists and explanations in this chapter tell him how to figure out what the difficulty number should be.) If you roll equal to or high- er than the difficulty number, your character succeeded at what she was trying to do Now you know the one major rule you need to play this game.

SKILL DESCRIPTIONS
**Time Taken:** This is generally how long it takes to do something with the skill. Many skills (especially combat skills) can be used in one round. More complex skills, like computer programming/repair, may take a round ... or min- utes, hours or even days to do something. These are gen- eral guidelines; the gamemaster can always customize the time taken depending upon the situation.
**Specializations:** Characters may choose a specialization for a skill. The kinds of specializations are explained, and several examples are provided in italics.
The skill description tells you what the skill covers and gives a few sample difficulties and modifiers.

We've broken down the skills into folders in this directory. You may consult these for 2e REUP's skills, or consult the 1e folder for that edition's skills. If using a custom or reduced skill list, we recommend consulting the difficulty guidelines here anyways, as actions that may now fall under the umbrella of a different name under your system will likely have thought devoted to them in the original book.
