**Cultural Learning:** At the time of character creation only, Epicanthix characters receive 2D for every 1D of skill dice they allocate to cultures, languages or value.

**Story Factors**
**Galactic Naivete:** Since the Epicanthix homeworld is in the isolated Pacanthe Reach section, they are not too familiar with many galactic institutions outside of their sphere of influence. They sometimes become overwhelmed with unfamiliar and fantastic surroundings of other worlds far from their own.
