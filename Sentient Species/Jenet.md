**Special Abilities**
**Enhanced Memory:** A Jenet that has at least 1D in any
Knowledge skill automatically gains a +1D bonus to the use
of that skill because of its memory.
**Astrogation:** Because Jenets can memorize coordinates and
formulas, a Jenet with at least 1D in astrogation gains +1D
to its roll.

**Swimming:** Jenets can advance the swimming skill at half the normal Character Point cost.
**Climbing:** Jenets can advance the climbing skill at half the normal Character Point cost.
**Flexibility:** Jenets can disjoint their limbs to fit through incredibly small openings.

**Story Factors**
**Tactless:** Despite their memories, the Jenet have not learned the secrets of tact. They will freely embarrass or insult any other being which they encounter. Among other Jenets, this is of no concern, for the embarrassed or insulted partly usually possesses knowledge which it in turn can use to offend its offender. In the Jenets, this type of interaction is a measure of pride - if you cannot be insulted, then you have not gained enough notoriety - however, other beings are not as understanding.
**Reputation Value:** Jenet value reputations. When they introduce their friends, they will describe their friends’ accomplishments in glowing, often exaggeratory, terms. Their enemies get less favorable treatment. A few Jenet are sensitive when they are not introduced in the same way by their non-Jenet friends (their Jenet friends will always remember to do this). Sometimes, this presents difficulties for those seeking discretion
