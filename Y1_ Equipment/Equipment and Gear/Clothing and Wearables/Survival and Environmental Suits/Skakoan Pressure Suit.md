**Game Notes:** 

The Skakoan designed three different types of pressure suits to protect them from the adverse effects of atmospheres other than the one found on their homeworld:

> **Light Pressure Suit:** +1D physical, +1 energy.

> **Medium Pressure Suit:** +1D+2 physical, +1D energy, -1 to Dexterity.

> **Heavy Pressure Suit:** +2D+1 physical, +1D+1 energy, -1D to Dexterity.

All Skakoan pressure suits incorporate a vocalizer that distorts the wearer’s speech patterns, making it difficult to tell one suited Skakoan from another. If an attack deals a Wounded result on a suit’s wearer, there’s a 50% that the suit will rupture, exposing its wearer to hostile atmospheric conditions. Although not designed for it, the pressure suit can protect a non-Skakoan from the harmful effects of Skako’s dense, oxygen-poor atmosphere.
