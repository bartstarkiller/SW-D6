**Game Notes:** 
> This unit is used much like starship shields, except that it is character scale. Initial activation requires an **Easy** melee parry roll, which generates a round shield 50 centimeters in diameter.
>
>A character may take a melee parry round – if the roll is higher than the firer’s blaster roll (as per normal shield rolls), the wearer has placed the force shield in the way. 
> 
> If the roll is lower than the attacker’s blaster roll, the character didn’t get the shield in place in time and was hit by the blast.
> 
> If the defender got the shield in place, the blaster bolt must roll against the shield’s defensive field of 4D to see if it penetrates the field (use the protection rules). 
> 
> Any further damage affects the target as indicated in the chart “Cover Modifiers”. The power cell will work for two minutes before being drained.
