**Move: 12**
**Size: varies widely; typically one meter radius, 10 cm thick**

**Special Abilities**
**Amorphous:** the Maoi can flow through openings up to five centimeters wide.
**Ta-Ree:** The Maoi are naturally adept with Ta-Ree but generally only use these abilities to defend their colonies.
**Descentralized Nervous System:** The Maoi have a highly decentralized nervous system, and can absorb more damage than an equivalently sized creature: +2D to Strength to resist all damage.
**Alien Thoughts:** Their thought processes are radically alien,
and their minds cannot be read by other species; any
attempt to do so registers only deep hunger.
**Internal Devouring Attack:** The Maoi usually consume a victim from inside. This attack ignores all armor. Succesfully resisting the attack (rolling higher than the Maoi) indicates that the alien is ejected.

**Story Factors**
Maoi attack anything that enters their territory, and are universally hated, feared and avoided by the other Kathol sentient species.
