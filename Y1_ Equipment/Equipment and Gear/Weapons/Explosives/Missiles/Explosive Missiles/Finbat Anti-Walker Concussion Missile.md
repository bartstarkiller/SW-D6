> **Game Notes:**
> **On Target:** If the attacker’s result, compared to the difficulty number, is less than or equal to 7, then the weapon was not fired accurately and the Finbat’s damage result is automatically halved.
> 
> **Interception**: Because the Finbat is slow on takeoff, the missile takes at least **two rounds** to reach a Long Range target and may be fired upon before it strikes. The difficulty level of shooting down a Finbat under flight is **Very Difficult**. If struck, compare the attacker’s damage with the Finbat’s own Body attribute.
