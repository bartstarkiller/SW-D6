**Game Notes:** 
> Encryption technology requires a **Heroic** communications roll to decrypt if intercepted. The Hush-98 also creates a tiny field of white noise around the comlink and whoever holds it, making it difficult to overhear what is said into the unit (**-2D search penalty to overhear**) or sounds coming out of it (**-3D**x search penalty).
