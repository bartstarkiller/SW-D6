> **Game Notes:** 
> The thud bug, unlike the razorbug, is not thrown. Instead, it is released, and guides itself towards its target with an attack skill of 5D. A thud bug that misses its target will continue to attack each round until it either hits, or is destroyed. If it hits, it inflicts the listed damage. The target must also make a Moderate Strength roll to keep his footing, otherwise he is knocked prone. Once the bug hits, it returns to its dormant state until activated again.
