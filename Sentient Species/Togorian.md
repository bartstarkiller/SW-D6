## Overview

"_I don't advise shooting a Togorian. It only makes them angry._"

―Talon Karrde[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Togorian/Legends#cite_note-VotF-3)

The **Togorian** people were a feline warrior species native to the planet [Togoria](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Togoria/Legends "Togoria/Legends"). They were known for their association with the [Mandalorians](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalorian/Legends "Mandalorian/Legends"), and the unique cultural divisions between their [sexes](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gender/Legends "Gender/Legends"). Both male and female Togorians were also noted for their strong sense of honor.

## Biology and Appearance

As a species, they were large bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians were up to 2.2 meters tall, while adult males ranged up to 3.0 meters. They were covered in gray-white to black fur, often with more colorful spots or stripes. They had extremely dense bone tissue, allowing them to endure greater physical trauma than beings with similar physiques.[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Togorian/Legends#cite_note-The_Essential_Guide_to_Alien_Species-1)
