This insectile race of humanoids is native to the planet Rior. Their large heads are dominated by a drooping cranial sac, and they lack noses and mouths. In their place is a series of chitinous gills that protect the Riorianâ€™s respiratory organs and ingestion tissues. The average Riorian has large, red eyes. They are a peaceful species.
