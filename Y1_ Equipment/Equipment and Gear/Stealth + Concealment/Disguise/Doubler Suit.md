**Game Notes:**
> Once programmed, an **Easy** Mechanical roll will allow projection of lifelike image duplicating the character. The image can be projected in any direction, up to 10 meters away. The operating character should secretly inform the gamemaster of attempts to project the holo image, specifying location and distance relative to the true individual. If a successful roll is made, all others will see the apparent image of original character projected as previously indicated. Viewers must make **Very Difficult** Perception or search roll to discover the true nature of the image (at a range of 50 meters or more; for every 10 meters close to the target, reduce the difficulty by one level).
