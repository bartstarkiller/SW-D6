#Tchuukthai 

**Wookiepedia**


## Society and Culture

Tchuukthai are contem-plative, free thinking, secretive, and slow to anger. Some prefer to be left alone, while others seem genuinely interested in meeting new species. Depending on their general demeanor, Tchuukthai are either annoyed or amused by other species’ reactions to their appearance and size. They disdain conflict but fight fiercely when sufficiently provoked. Physical Description: Tchuukthai are hulking, quadrupedal brutes with thick leathery skin, wide-set eyes, flaring nostrils, and sharp fangs. Bristling fur covers their shoulders and backs, and armor plating protects their head, joints, and vital organs. An adult Tchuukthai stands 2 meters tall at the shoulder or 3 meters tall when standing upright on his or her hind legs. Tchuukthai who consort with other species typically don clothing; others do not.

Bval, Drol, Gaarx, Huun, Nrak, Thon, Tkur, Zvod are examples of Tchuukthai names.

## History

For centuries, the Tchuukthai were considered little more than beasts. Their brutish appearance and vocabulary of grunts and growls helped perpetuate that myth—a misperception the Tchuukthai were more than happy to see thrive. Over several centuries, Tchuukthai were discovered morethan once. Most times, explorers avoided contact with these seemingly dangerous creatures. The few who couldn’t resist the urge to learn more about them were met with vicious snarls and displays of ferocity. Their true intelligence remained a secret until a Jedi Master encountered them. The Jedi, whose name is lost in antiquity, explained much about the galaxy to a Tchuukthai he’d befriended. The Tchuukthai’s interest was piqued, but he was wary of leaving his home and fearful that his people would be exploited if their true nature were known. The Jedi gave his word that he would protect their secret and offered to train the Tchuukthai in the ways of the Force. This Tchuukthai later became Jedi Master Thon of Ambria. For thousands of years, Master Thon was the only Tchuukthai who had ventured into the galaxy. Only the Jedi knew his true nature. Since that time, other Tchuukthai might have ventured beyond their home system, perhaps even as pets or zoological exhibits. During the time of the New Republic, their existence is still considered a rumor across most of the galaxy.
