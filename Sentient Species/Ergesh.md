**Natural Body Armor:** The tough hides of the Ergesh give them +2D against physical attacks and +1D against energy attacks.

**Environment Field Belt:** To survive in standard atmospheres, Ergesh must wear a special belt, which produces a nitrogen field around the individual and retains a vast majority of moisture. Without the belt, Ergesh suffers 2D worth of damage every round and -2 to all skills and attributes until returning to a nitrogen field or death.
