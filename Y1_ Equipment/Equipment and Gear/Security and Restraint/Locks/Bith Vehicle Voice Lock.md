**Game Notes:** 
> An **Easy** communications total is required to properly encode the BiVVoL or change an established pattern. Normal activation by the owner with voice command code is automatic within a 10-meter range (if the owner is willing). The owner can alter the command sequence’s tone to fail an activation if under duress. A failed attempt to circumvent a BiVVoL means that the vehicle’s power system is disabled until the secondary system establishes identity. Attempting to “forge” a voice replication requires a voice replication unit with sound adjustment functions, at least three hours of work creating the forgery, and a Moderate communications roll and a Moderate forgery roll.
