**Wookiepedia Entry**

The **Massassi** were a subspecies of the Sith species/Legends who were enslaved by exiled Dark Jedi on Korriban. Massassi were fearsome, loyal, and formidable warriors, and as such comprised the warrior class in the Sith caste system. Their culture dictated life solely to serve their Sith masters, but once freed, the loyal Massassi dedicated themselves only to the life they chose.

## Biology and Appearance

Like the rest of the Sith species, the Massassi subspecies were native to the planet [[Korriban]], within the isolated Stygian Caldera in the Outer Rim Territories. They, like the few other creatures that inhabited Korriban, derived sustenance directly from the dark side of the Force, in part of a natural symbiotic relationship where Sith—like the Massassi—fed on the dark side, and empowered it in turn. Thus the entire Sith race, including the Massassi, had such a high rate of Force-sensitivity that they were considered a naturally Force-sensitive species.

Phenotypically, Massassi were quite similar to the rest of the Sith species. Common to all Sith, Massassi skin was red, ranging from florid  crimsons to lighter pinks. Massassi had fierce, predatory profiles, and sharp\ bone spurs protruding over their bodies in various locations —especially the elbows. Other facial features included a pair of tendrils that hung from their cheekbones, and cartilaginouseyebrow stalks that covered their eyes. They also had simian mouths, small noses and ears, and a slightly receding chin. Like other Sith, Massassi had three digits on each of their hands and feet.

Exclusive to their subspecies however, Massassi possessed large glowing yellow eyes. Unlike mainline Sith, the eyes of Massassi did not display details such as pupils or whites of any sort—instead the yellow seemed to cover the whole of each eye. Massassi were also taller, larger, and more hulking humanoids than the species they hailed from,  reaching between two and three meters in height, and an average weight of ninety-five kilograms. Massassi senses were very acute compared to those of Humans—particularly their hearing.   Massassi also had an extremely tough skin; powerful cauterizing agents such as [[cyanogen silicate]] were needed to provide Massassi with medical assistance. Nothing weaker was capable of corroding their resistant hides.

Relative to other species, Massassi were quite short lived. The typical Massassi childhood lasted ten standard years, with the next three standard years constituting young adulthood. Massassi adulthood typically began at around fourteen standard years of age. Middle age started after twenty-five standard years of life, and old age after thirty-five years. Any Massassi over the age of fifty standard years were considered venerable.

The Massassi under the command of Naga Sadow that relocated to Yavin 4 after the Great Hyperspace War underwent alchemical alterations under the supervision of Sadow. These individuals and their descendants became more hunched and monstrous than the original Massassi species, and were gradually considered more like savage brutes than the warriors they once were. At this point, they became large creatures with sharp claws and grotesque fin-like growths on their head and back.

Also while on Yavin 4, Exar Kun enslaved the Massassi' to build temples. When a mournful Ulic Qel-Droma turned on him, he destroyed the Massassi and trapped his and their spirits in the temples to live forever.

## History
The Massassi were a mysterious species that built enormous stone temples of unknown purpose on the fourth moon of Yavin some five thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Whether the Massassi had evolved on Yavin 4 or were a slave race in thrall of the Sith and brought to that moon was unknown, although the latter seemed more likely.

Five thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, the ancient Massassi warriors lived on [[Yavin 4]] and constructed the Great Temple.The Great Temple was alleged to have been built under the leadership of the Sith Lord Naga Sadow. The Massassi admired Sadow as a god despite being poorly treated by him, and the Temple was raised in Sadow's honor. Archeologists later proposed that the Great Temple may have functioned as a large-scale communications device to contact other Sith Lords throughout the galaxy. The species went extinct millennia before 0 ABY, sometime after finishing their temples.

At some point, either as part of the original intent of the building or through ulterior additions, the Jedi splinter group known as the Ordu Aspectu used one of the Massassi temples, the Great Temple, to store information, including a map room that gave directions to their hidden space station-fortress base, the Citadel of Rur. The Massassi piece crystals were associated with the Massassi and were used as activation keys at the Great Temple, and at the headquarters of the Ordu Aspectu. They were almost identical in shape to the Massassi temples on Yavin 4.

As a subspecies of the Sith race, the ancient Massassi presumably originated on Korriban because of the other Sith subspecies originating from there. Since Sith society lasted as such for hundreds of centuries—from roughly 100,000 BBY to 7000 BBY, it is presumed that the Massassi also had an ancient history. Around 27,700 BBY, they along with the priest caste were resettled from their home world to the Sith Empire's capital of [[Ziost]].

Around 7000 BBY, Dark Jedi exiles fleeing from the Galactic Republic after their defeat in the Hundred-Year Darkness, established themselves as "divine" rulers over their native Sith, uniting the world once again and created a new Sith Empire, this time under the rule of a Dark Lord of the Sith. Over the generations, the Sith interbred with the Human Dark Jedi through a practice of the intermixing of Human and Sith bloodlines which became known as Sith Alchemy. The new Dark Jedi masters found the Massassi useful and used them as their tools of power for the Sith Empire. Much of the Sith Empire's military was composed of Massassi.

## Abomination Engineering

Sadow fled to the jungle moon of Yavin 4 along with a contingent of Massassi followers to escape the pursuing Jedi and the Galactic Republic. There, Sadow committed cruel experiments on his own Massassi warriors which resulted in them becoming dark side wielding savages. Despite these abuses, the Massassi treated Sadow as a god, building huge temples and palaces to honor their Lord. Eventually the Massassi on the moon devolved into a primitive hunter-warrior society. At some point during the construction of the Massassi Temple's, they created the Yavin Vassilika that contained a key to one of the more strategically important temples. %% oh god FIX the wookiepedia 3rd grade storytelling ingenuity %%

In 3997 BBY, Exar Kun elevated himself to the status of a god and enslaved the Massassi members on Yavin IV. He then forced them to construct a great complex of temples that were used in arcane Sith ceremonies and rites. He also experimented on his slaves and created the Golden Globe that trapped the children of the Massassi and allowed him to drain their energies for his own purposes. During the Sith War in 3996 BBY, Exar Kun sapped the life out most of the Massassi on Yavin 4 so that he could free his soul from his body in order to escape the pursuing Jedi. Some of the Massassi survived Kun's ritual, one example was Kalgrath. In addition, there were Massassi living on other worlds. For example, there was at least one Massassi living on Korriban in 3993 BBY, and reports of isolated villages of both [[Kissai]] and Massassi on Korriban and [[Tund]].


Though nearly annihilated, some Massassi had previously been taken off world which meant that the species was not largely extinct at the time. Some of its members, however, quickly went into the service of the new Sith Empire that had formed during the Jedi Civil War. Some also remained neutral as they were resentful of the treatment done to their race by the Sith. These Massassi either decided to continue a life where they could live in peace while others stayed in the fringes of society and sought revenge against the Sith.

In the years before the Great Galactic War, the True Sith hiding in the shadows of the galaxy began dispatching their infiltrated agents in the Jedi Order such as Barel Ovair to remove any threats posed by ancient dark side spirits such as that of Naga Sadow. To that end, he travelled with his Padawan Eison Gynt to Yavin 4 to study the temple there though Gynt was unaware of his master's true allegiance. Upon arriving, they were attacked by the native Massassi who had survived the events caused by Exar Kun, and overwhelmed Ovair and Gynt to the point that they fled to Sadow's tomb. From the encounter, only Master Ovair emerged and returned to the Jedi Council. Seven years later, Gynt emerged wearing Massassi warrior robes and had been possessed by the dark side spirit of Naga Sadow from the tomb. Gynt attacked master Ovair in broad daylight with all the Republic watching, and although a formidable opponent with Sadow's powers, Ovair was able to defeat the possessed Gynt.

Around four hundred years before the Battle of Yavin, the [[Kushiban]] Jedi Master Ikrit discovered the Golden Globe in the ruined Palace of the Woolamander and since he was unable to free the Massassi from the swirling golden sand within the globe, placed himself in [[hibernation]] for centuries, until the right being or beings arrived. Many scholars believed that the species had gone extinct by the time of the rise of the Empire though it was possible that some managed to survive on forgotten Sith worlds or had devolved into predatory savages on distant worlds. Finally, in 22 ABY, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila freed the trapped spirits from the swirling golden sand of the globe, and in the process befriended the mysterious Ikrit. By this point, the Massassi were largely extinct with many archaeologists as well as linguists attempting to learn more about the mysterious race. The last known member of the species, known as Kalgrath, departed to the former strongholds of the Sith Empire Ziost, but little else was known about his fate.


During the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, the Massassi proved to be formidable and savage warriors that fought against the Galactic Republic on behalf of the Sith Lords. Some Massassi were aboard the _Omen_ and were stranded on the planet Kesh, though they soon succumbed to incompatible gases within the planet's atmosphere. Despite the fury of the Massassi, the Sith Empire was defeated and forced to return to Sith Space where they were pursued and attacked by the pursuing Republic forces. In order to survive, the Dark Lord Naga Sadow commanded his loyal Massassi to give their lives and delay the Republic so he could escape. This resulted in the Massassi assassinating their Sith Lords on board Sadow's fleet and engaging the Republic thus giving their master the chance to flee the battlefield.

## Surviving Records
The purple-barked Massassi trees found on Yavin 4 were named after the species.

Sometime before the Battle of Coruscant, an archaeological dig on the moon of Yavin 4 uncovered the Great Sith Wars Bas-Relief in one of the enormous stone temples built by the Massassi.

After setting up a rebel cell on Yavin 4, General Jan Dodonna decided to honor the Massassi by naming his cell after them.

After their extinction, the Massassi warriors were mentioned in a travel advertisement written by a Special Galaxy Reporter who had investigated the Great Temple ruins after the Alliance to Restore the Republic abandoned the jungle moon.
