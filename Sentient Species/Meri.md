**Knowledge skills**
**Weather Prediction:** Time to use: one minute. This skill allows Meris to accurately predict weather on Merisee and similar worlds. This is a Moderate task on planets with climate conditions similar to Merisee. The task’s difficulty increases the more the planet’s climate differs from Merisee’s. The prediction is effective for four hours; the difficulty increases if the Meri wants to predict over a longer period of time.
**Agriculture:** Time to use: five minutes. Agriculture enables the user to know when and where to best plant crops, how to keep the crops alive, how to rid them of pests, and how to best harvest and store them.

**Special Abilities**
**Skill Bonus:** Meris can choose to focus on one of the following skills: agriculture, first aid or medicine. They receive a bonus of +2D to the skill, and advancing that skill costs half the normal amount of skill points.
**Stealth:** Meris gain a +2D bonus when using sneak.

**Wookiepedia**

The **Meri** were a tall humanoid race with dark blue skin, similar to the [[Teltior]], with whom they shared the planet Merisee. Distinguishing features included a strongly-pronounced eyebrow ridge, a slightly conical ridge on the top of their head, webbed hands with an opposable thumb and finger, inward-spiraling cartilage in the ear, and several thick folds of skin around the neck.

%% included only because i thought 'Loag' sounded interesting, and offers a design explanation to the wildly polar OP strats of Star Doctor and Ninja, to ensure the template could manage either: Some Meris were associated with the Cult of Those Who Redeem, though others were part of the Loag cult of assassins. %%
