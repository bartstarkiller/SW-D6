## Overview

The **Ssamb** were large [sapient](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sentience/Legends "Sentience/Legends") [arachnids](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Spider/Legends "Spider/Legends") indigenous to [Kathol](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kathol_(planet) "Kathol (planet)"). They were created by the [DarkStryder](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DarkStryder "DarkStryder") to serve as its guardians. They appeared as headless creatures which moved on its six legs and attacked with large fangs. Within the DarkStryder's fortress, there were swarms of these creatures that would move across the many surfaces, constantly in search for any intruders. They were genetically engineered to serve their master and would do so at the cost of their own lives. The fortress possessed a guard complement of 500 Ssamb while 1,000 served as the DarkStryder's personal guard.
