Background
The A310 rifle was a model of blaster rifle manufactured by BlasTech Industries. It had a perforated, air-cooling barrel-shroud that was white in color while the rest of the rifle was black. The weapon also included a scope, and a strap that attached to the end of the barrel. It was one of a large line of blasters that looked very similar, including the A300, A280, and the A280-CFE. In the year 0 BBY, the Britarro bounty hunter Nik Hepho carried a A310 with him while he worked in Jedha City on the moon Jedha
