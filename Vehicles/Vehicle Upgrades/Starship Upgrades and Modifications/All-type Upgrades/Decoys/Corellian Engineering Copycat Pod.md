**Game Notes:** 
> This device mimics the performance of the parent vessel when used aboard a starfighter or small transport freighter (ship with a cargo hold of 100 metric tons or less); it has a maximum Space speed of 6. Any person attempting to distinguish a copycat pod from a “live” vessel must make a Difficult sensor roll on passive or scan mode (Moderate on search mode and Easy on focus mode) to determine which ship is real and which is the decoy. If the roll fails, the sensor operator will perceive both ships as being “real”.
