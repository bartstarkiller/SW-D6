**Special Skills**
**Dexterity skills:**
**Web Slinging:** Time to use: One round. This is the skill that allows a Damaronian to use its webs. This is a ranged attack of 3/7/15.

**Special Abilities**
**Danger Sense:** (**Females** **only**) This ability works exactly like the Force power danger sense. It is an unattributed skill that starts with 2D and can have up to 2D in beginning skill dice put into it. It is raised at double the Character Point cost of a normal skill.

**Infrared Vision:** (**Females** **only**) Their vision allows female Damaronians to see objects based on heat intensity allowing for sight in near-darkness.

**Web Slinging:** (**Both**) A Damaronian can shoot up to three webs from each wrist before having to take a day to allow for the production of more webs. Webs have a 4D Strength, and do 4D entangle.

**Story Factors**
**Condescension Toward Males:** Female Damaronians hold males in contempt as weak and only to be used. They won’t necessarily underestimate a male because of this, but that has been known to happen. They usually just don’t give him a chance.
