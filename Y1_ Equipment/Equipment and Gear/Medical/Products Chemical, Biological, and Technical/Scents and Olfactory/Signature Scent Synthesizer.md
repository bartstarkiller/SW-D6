**Game Notes:** 
> Some fragrances may contain biological ingredients (such as pheromonal additives) that may induce an exceptionally strong effect on some beings. In game terms, “victims” of such pheromonal fragrances might suffer penalties to willpower rolls to avoid infatuation or resist the effect of command, con, persuasion and similar skills. Enterprising characters with the appropriate chemistry background may concoct all kinds of substances with a number of psychological effects.
