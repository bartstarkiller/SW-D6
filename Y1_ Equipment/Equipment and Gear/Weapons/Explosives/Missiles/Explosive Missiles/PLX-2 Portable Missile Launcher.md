**Game Notes:**
> The range above represents the “dumb” rocket mode. The alternate GAM mode gives missile a target lock range of 25-500/1/2 km; if roll to hit the target fails but is within five of the difficulty number, the missile has achieved a target lock on the target. The missile has a tracking ability of 4D, moves 550 meters per move and may roll once per round to hit the target, with a maximum range of 40 kilometers. If tracking rolls miss difficulty number by a total of 10 or more, the missile has lost its target
