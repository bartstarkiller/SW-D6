**Game Notes:**
> The plasma torch boarding device is mounted on a ship’s airlock system. The controls are just inside the main airlock. The extendable plasma torch (fire control 0D, range of 4 meters, damage 8D) slowly cuts through a ship’s hull. Roll the target ship’s hull -2D; if the torch’s roll scores “lightly damaged” result, it has breached the hull. Once the hull is breached, the torch requires a full minute to cut a one meter wide by two meter high hole. The extendable boarding tube attaches to the hull and forms an airtight seal in 30 seconds.
