A custom engineered modification of the dubiously legal [[Vitapill]], a 'cracked' Vitapill produces a stimulant high using a certainly illegal combination of secondary active ingredients. 

To make, a pillcutter roughly punctures the shell of a Vitapill so that it cracks and splits into hemispheres. Single or additional secondary stimulants are carefully poured into the gap with [[spice]], [[gwua-gwua]], or [[Ringo zauce]]  being popular choices on Coruscanti after-work upper level hangouts. 

The shell is then dipped in a sweetresin to seal the opening, and left to drip-dry on rotating tall racks with other shells. The resin weakens the remains of the old shell and creates a smooth and vibrant new capsule, crunchable to the teeth and dissolvable in the mouth. The constant drying motion gets drops of various flavored resins (and allegedly, their potentially varied secondary ingredients) onto other resins, with a marbled and multi-colored pill being referred to and desired by connoisseurs as 'well-aged'. A cracked Vitapill is often rolled in fizzrocks for symphonic pops. 

The end product is enjoyed in the same manner as a mixed drink, though the foaming mouth effect from fizzrocks, resin, and saliva is mirrored in few liquid treats.
