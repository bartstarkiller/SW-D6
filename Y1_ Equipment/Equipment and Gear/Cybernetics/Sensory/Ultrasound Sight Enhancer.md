Cost: 12,500; does not include cost of implantation surgery
Availability: 4

**Game Notes:** 
> Sensory motion system implant feeds input directly into the user’s brain, creating a three-dimensional, black and white, sonic graph of the user’s surrounding. An **Easy** sensors total is required to properly calibrate wave receptors once implantation nodes are in place. Otherwise, a **Very Easy** Perception roll is required periodically (varies according to species) for normal use. Normal operating range is 50 meters and function is equally good in all environmental conditions excepting those involving severe electrical disturbances.
