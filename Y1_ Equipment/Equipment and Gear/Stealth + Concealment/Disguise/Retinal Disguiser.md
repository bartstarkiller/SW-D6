Skill: Medicine
Cost: 25,000 (black market)

> Game Notes: Normal operation requires an **Easy** medicine total. In the event that a pre-existing pattern has been loaded into the device (rather than storing a live subject scan), the gamemaster must determine the relative accuracy of the pattern. This may require the user to make a higher difficulty roll. Users deemed to be sufficiently proficient may attempt to manufacture their own retinal patterns “from scratch”. Such attempts will result in higher medicine difficulties.
