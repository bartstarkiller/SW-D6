Homeworld: [[Ruusan]]
**No Stats Yet**

Once native to the planet Ruusan, bouncers were a species of round-bodied, avian creatures who moved through air as if levitating. Their bodies were covered with greenish fur, and their long tails drifted behind them as they moved about. Innately intelligent, bouncers could not communicate vocally, but spoke to one another through a form of telepathy. They were connected to the Force, and often had dreams which revealed images of the future. However, bouncers could also be killed by dreams which were too violent, and many died in this way in the months and weeks leading up to the Battle of Ruusan. Those who survived were riven slowly mad, as they tried to offer comfort and support to the Jedi but were met only with pain and suffering. In the aftermath of the war between the Jedi and the Sith, the bouncers were all but destroyed.
