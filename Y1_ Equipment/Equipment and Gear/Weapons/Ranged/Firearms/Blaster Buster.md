> **Game Notes:** 
> The user must make a firearms roll to successfully target the blaster weapon. Once targeted, as long as the blaster is in the same general area and is still in line of sight, the projectile will home in on the weapon. Damage is rolled against the blaster’s body (normally 1D- 2D). Laser targeting disperses after 10 seconds.
