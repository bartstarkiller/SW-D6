## Ropagu

> [!_3] 
> ### Overview
> The **Ropagu** were Near-Humans who lived on [[Ropagi II]]. They could have purple skin.
> 
> They were the creators of the Great Library, containing thousands of years of Ropagu history.
> 
> The Ropagu were often hosts for the [[Kalduu]], a species also indigenous to Ropagi II. The two species had a long-standing friendship. Ropagu evolution has been shaped by the Kalduu, specializing in peaceful cooperation as the Kalduu prevent them from exploring thoughts of civil conflict that harmed  Ropagu's past.

 %% Do the Ropagu have evolutionary will? The Kalduu have essentially taken over their entire species. %%
## Kalduu

> [!_3] 
> ### Biology and Appearance
> 
> The Kalduu had transparent bodies, with four tentacles that extended below their hemispherical body. They breathed carbon dioxide and exhaled oxygen. Kalduu reproduced by fission. As they lacked vocal cords, Kalduu communicated telepathically. They could form a group mind if two or more Kalduu were within 60 meters of one another. This could be extended to their hosts, which were most often Ropagu, with whom they had a long-standing friendship. Kalduu ate airborne bacteria as well as germs and viruses from their hosts.
> 
> ### Society and Culture
> 
> The Kalduu and the Ropagu had a symbiotic relationship. The Ropagu benefited from the medicinal abilities of the Kalduu while they were able to feed on the infections of their hosts.
> 
> ### History
> 
> They were able to stop the Ropagu civil wars. They bonded with the minds of Ropagu leaders during a period of conflict and filled their heads with peaceful thoughts. This influenced the Ropagu into a state of harmonious coexistence.
