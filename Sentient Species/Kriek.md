**Move: 6/8**
**Size: 1.2-1.5 meters tall, 3 meters long**
**Special Abilities**
**Voice Box:** Due to their unusual voice apparatus, Krieks are unable to pronounce Basic, although they can understand it perfectly well.

**Toxic Atmosphere:** Krieks live in an atmosphere with amounts of metals and gases considered toxic by most species, and cannot survive without assistance in atmospheres other than Type IV.

**Infrared Vision:** Krieks can see into the infrared spectrum, giving them the ability to see in complete darkness if there are heat sources to navigate by.

**Sense Vibration:** Krieks are attuned to movements and vibrations and can sense approaching objects in contact with the ground up to 60 meters away on their homeworld. Using this ability a **Very Easy** Perceptionroll. If a Kriek is removed from his natural environment this sense still functions, but requires a Perception roll with a difficulty based upon the amount of ground vibrations present in the area (i.e., Moderate for an average city street, Heroic for an area near starship take-offs).

**Natural Body Armor:** A Kriek’s strong shell provides +1D against both physical and energy attacks.

**Story Factors**
**Developing:** Krieks are capable of fairly complex metalworks, but are still at a tribal stage of society and have not developed the higher institutional learning necessary to achieve many of the “modern” galactic skills. Krieks cannot start with any skills representing anything beyond their homeworld’s tech level except for languages and alien species, which they are rapidly learning.

**Pacifism:** Despite the existence of a warrior class of Krieks, their duties are mostly ceremonial, as the Krieks in general are a very quiet, gentle people. When faced with combat situations, most Kriek withdraw into their shells to wait out the danger.
