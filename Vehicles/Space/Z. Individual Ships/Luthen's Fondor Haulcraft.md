**Background**
Luthen Rael’s Fondor Haulcraft was a heavily modified version of a V-21.1 Chevlex used by Luthen Rael in 5 BBY. The ship, which Rael called “the Fondor,” had an added droid Mod serving as a co-pilot and multiple hidden countermeasures such as laser beams and a projectile launcher.

During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, Rael used the ship to travel to Ferrix, where he met with Cassian Andor to recruit him for a heist on the Imperial headquarters of the planet Aldhani. He later used the ship to visit Saw Gerrera on Segra Milo, where the ship was engaged by and managed to damage the Imperial patrol cruiser.

Axis network spymaster Luthen Rael’s personal ship, nicknamed a “Fondor Haulcraft” was a V-21.1 Chevlex light haulcraft manufactured by Fondor Yards Commercial Ventures. It featured a spacious luxury interior in addition to significant combat-focused modifications, reflecting its owner’s double role. Its cockpit was modified to include a Fondor Droid Mod, an artificial intelligence functioning as Rael’s copilot and navigator, eliminating the need for support crew positions. The Mod could take full control of the transport, communicate in Galactic Basic Standard, recognize Rael’s whistle as a signal to unlock and activate the ship and guard it against trespassers. Despite these capacities, Rael distrusted the droid and erased its memory banks after every mission. The spymaster considered his ship a closely guarded secret and rarely allowed anyone to enter it, carefully storing it behind his shop in Coruscant.

For additional security, the ship’s navigational computer was triple-encrypted with a unique cipher system based on extinct languages, with only Rael and his assistant Kleya Marki possessing the key to unlock it and Rael wiping it clean after every mission. In addition, the haulcraft was equipped with electronic countermeasures that could simulate systems malfunctions carefully constructed to be picked up on enemy sensors and accompanied by the expected evidence such as hard radiation and heat signatures. A simulated reactor meltdown could cause a search party to keep its distance, while a thruster malfunction could buy Rael time until he could “repair.”

The ship’s living quarters included a hidden compartment behind a fake wall with various disguises, allowing Rael to perfect his image as a rich antique collector.

The Haulcraft’s hidden advantage against attackers was its extensive offensive and defensive modifications. It featured a targeting computer that was able to lock and engage targets autonomously with a hidden dorsal laser cannon turret that could be deployed from the Haulcraft’s roof, as well as a rear-mounted ballistic chaff launcher that could launch myriads of tiny projectiles against a target. Additionally, Rael had added two side-mounted laser beam projectors, which, once activated, would project two powerful continuous-stream laser beams, one from each side of the transport, to slice through targets. Although requiring a lengthy power-up process before being used, these countermeasures were effective in dispatching enemy starfighters. In addition, the ship was equipped with two forward-mounted laser cannons and several antipersonnel blasters. It also had modified engines that were so strong that they required a tractor beam intensity level of at least five to immobilize.

To power all these, the ship also boasted a non-standard reactor, which granted the ship the additional benefit of having a hyperdrive. Rael had also equipped the transport with passive protection measures, including stealth technology, which allowed the ship to slip out of tightly patrolled zones undetected and interior space for a single speeder bike. The ship was also fitted with a bottom front hatch and an escape pod on the side of the cockpit module.
