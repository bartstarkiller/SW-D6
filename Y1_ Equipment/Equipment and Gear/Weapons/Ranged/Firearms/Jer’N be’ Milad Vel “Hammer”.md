> **Game Notes:** 
> The Hammer’s extreme recoil requires the user to make a **Moderate Strength** roll after the weapon is fired. If the roll fails, additional shots in that round or in the next round are at an additional <u>-1D </u>penalty; if the character waits a full round before firing again, there is no penalty. If the character succeeds at the **Strength** roll, there is no penalty beyond the normal multiple action penalties.
