> **Game Notes:** 
> Ion guns fire streams of energy that wreak havoc on electrical systems, and they are usually employed against droids, light vehicles, and some types of equipment. When used normally, an ion gun fries a droid’s circuits and internal components, inflicting lethal damage. If set to “stun,” it works much the same as a blaster set on stun works against organic opponents. A droid stunned in such a way is out of commission for 2D minutes. An ion gun’s blast has no effect on organic targets, unless such targets have cybernetic replacements.
