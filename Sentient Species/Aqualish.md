**Special Abilities**
**Fins:** Aqualish are born with the natural ability to swim. They receive a +2D bonus for all movement attempted
in liquids. However, the lack of fingers on their hands decreases their Dexterity, and the Aqualish suffer a -2D penalty when using equipment that has not been specially designed for its fins.
**Hands:** The Quara do not receive the swimming bonus, but they are just as “at home” in the water. They also receive no penalties for Dexterity actions. The Quara are most likely to be encountered off-world.

**Story Factors**
**Belligerence:** Aqualish tend to be pushy and obnoxious, always looking for the opportunity to bully weaker beings. More intelligent Aqualish turn this belligerence into cunning and become manipulators.
