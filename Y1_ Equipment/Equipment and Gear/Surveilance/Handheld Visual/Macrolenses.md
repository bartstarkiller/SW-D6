**Game Notes:**
> These are worn like contact lenses, and can alter the appearance of a person’s eyes (in Amaiza’s case, they make her eyes appear to be slitted like a cat’s). In addition to the cosmetic use, the macrolenses also add +2D to the wearer’s vision-related search rolls, and they reduce all range penalties by one grade (ie, Long Range becomes Medium Range, Medium Range becomes Short Range, etc.).
