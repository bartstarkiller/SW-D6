**Equipment Notes**
> **Needler Gun:** This needler gun is loaded with darts that contain a paralytic poison. The darts inflict no damage, but if used against an unarmored target (or an unarmored portion of a target, see the rules for called shots, SWD6, page 91), they inject their poison. The target of such an attack must succeed at a Difficult Strength check or be paralyzed and unable to move for 1D x 40 minutes (40-240 minutes). No ammunition total is listed, so assume the needler gun carries enough darts for ten shots.

> **Hunter-Seeker Missiles**: In order to get a missile lock on a target, the droid must make a successful Missile Weapons skill roll, the difficulty of which is based on range. If the target is aware of the droid, it may attempt a Dodge skill roll. If the lock-on is successful, the droid may fire the missile in the following turn. The missile rolls its skill score of 6D+2 to hit the target it has locked onto, with the difficulty based on range and other appropriate modifiers. A successful to-hit roll indicates that the target suffers damage. If the missile’s to-hit roll fails by less than eight points, it is allowed to make another attack roll on the following turn. If the to- hit roll fails by nine or more points, the missile deviates and explodes like a grenade (refer to the rules for grenade deviation, SWD6, page 92). No ammunition total is listed, so assume the droid has enough missiles for six shots.
