**Special Abilities**
**Moist Skin:** Draedan must keep their scales from drying out. They must immerse themselves in water once per 20 hours in moderately moist environments or once per four hours in very dry environments. Any Draedan who fails to do this will suffer extreme pain, causing -1D penalty to all actions for one hour. After that hour, the Draedan is so paralyzed by pain that he or she is incapable of moving or any other actions. 

**Water Breathing:** Draedans may breathe water and air. 
**Cold-blooded:** Due to their cold-blooded nature, Draedans may have to make a Difficult staminaroll once per 15 minutes to avoid collapsing in extreme heat (above 50 standard degrees) or cold (below -5 standard degrees).

**Claws:** Draedans get +1D to climbing and +1D to physical damage due to their claws.

**Prehensile Tail:** The tail of the Draedans is prehensile, and they may use it as a third hand. Some experienced Draedans keep a hold-out blaster strapped to their backs within reach of the tail.
