Scale: Character
Cost: 5,200
Availability: 4, X
Difficulty: **Difficult**
Damage: 5D

> **Game Notes:** 
> Great lightsabers have blades that reach up to 300 centimeters long. While the longer blade doesn’t increase the weapon’s damage, it does increase the reach of the wielder by 4 meters. If an attacking character **misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points** (the base difficulty; not their opponent’s parry total), the character has injured **themself** with the lightsaber.
