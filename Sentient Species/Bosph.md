**Story Factors**

**Religious:** Bosphs hold religion and philosophy in high regard and always try to follow some sort of religious code, be it abo b’Yentarr, Dimm-U, or something else.

**Different Concept of Possession:** Because of the unusual Bosph concept of possession, individuals often take others’ items without permission, believing that what belongs to one belongs to all or that ownership comes from simply placing a glyph on an item.

**Isolationism:** Bosphs are inherently solitary beings. They are also being isolated from the galaxy by the Imperial blockade of their system.
