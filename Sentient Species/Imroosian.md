## Overview

Imroosians were a sentient species that existed within the galaxy. During the High Republic Era, Archivist Ru-Ru was an Imroosian serving the Jedi Order at the temple on Banchii. Margo, Dryden Vosâ€™ concierge aboard First Light, was another notable Imroosian from the volcanic planet Imroosia. Imroosians developed flinty, chalk-like skin to adapt to their heated climate.
