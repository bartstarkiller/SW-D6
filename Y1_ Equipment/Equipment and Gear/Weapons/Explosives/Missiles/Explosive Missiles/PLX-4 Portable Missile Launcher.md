Game Notes: 
> Savant Rockets: Because of the computer system necessary to fire savant rockets, one round and a Moderate missile weapons roll is necessary to “tag” a target. If this roll is failed, it means that the “tag” system has not locked on the target and the weapon acts only as a “dumb” rocket, relying entirely on the missile weapons roll in the next round. If the roll is successful, the savant missile is considered to have a skill of 4D to hit the target (normally the rocket activates at point-blank range). The attacker must make a second missile weapons roll at normal difficulty for the straight-line rocket attack. *Note: Not available prior to the Battle of Endor.
