##### KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D+2
##### MECHANICAL 2D/4D
##### PERCEPTION 1D/3D
##### STRENGTH 1D/2D+2
##### TECHNICAL 2D/4D
**Move: 6/8**
**Size: 0.6-1.1 meters tall**

**Special Skills**
**Genetic Engineering (A):** Time to use: One month to several years. Character must have genetics at 6D before studying genetic engineering. This skill is the knowledge of genetics and how to manipulate the genetic code of creatures to bring about desired traits. Characters with the skill can use natural substances, genetic code restructuring and a number of other techniques to create “designer creatures” or beings for specific tasks or qualities.
**Genetics:** Time to use: One day to one month. Lurrians are masters of genetic engineering. This skill covers the basic knowledge of genetics, genetic theory and evolution.

**Special Abilities**
**Technological Ignorance:** While the Lurrians have a highly advanced culture, it is based on engineered life forms rather than technology. They suffer a penalty of -2D when operating machinery, vehicles, normal weapons, and other items of technology. This penalty is incurred until the Lurrian has had a great deal of experience with technology.

**Story Factors**
**Genetics:** Lurrians have highly developed knowledge of genetics. Lurrian characters raised in the Lurrian culture must place 2D of their beginning skill dice in genetics, (they may place up to 3D in the skill) but receive double the number of dice for the skill at the time of character creation.

**Enslaved:** Many Lurrians have been enslaved in recent years. Because of this, the Lurrians are fearful of humans and other aliens.

**Wookiepedia Entry**

## **Overview**
These humanoids were bipedal herbivores who possessed fine thick white fur as well as large green-blue eyes. The tallest of their kind were scarcely waist-high to a Human. The soles of their feet were thick, calloused pads. The species were adept at the disciplines of bioengineering and genetics, creating many animals including the Asgnat and Grebnar. They were seemingly descended from herbivoral stock and evolved to the point that they banded together into extended family units. This was partly a defensive mechanism as it allowed them to adequately protect one another from dangerous predators on their world. As true intelligence began to emerge amongst the species, social evolution allowed for a true understanding of the nature of their environment.

Their planet lacked any readily accessible resources such as wood and metal. However, the cold world of Lur had an abundance of lifeforms on its surface, including both animals and plants. The Lurrians first began to domesticate certain creatures, which initially led to them being used as food but eventually evolved into transportation and finally as construction tools. In time, they began to engage in selective breeding in order to bring about desirable traits in their lifeforms. They quickly began to learn that various herbs and similar compounds also had an impact on the genetic code of offspring and thus tapped into the art of bioengineering living organisms. As such, they genetically engineered creatures that ranged from construction to guard creatures, which served as an alternative to traditional forms of technology.

Lurrian society also evolved into a peaceful culture, and their long lives were often filled with joy and recreational activities. They were highly social beings and lived in cities that held several thousand each. In addition, family connections were strong amongst their people, and violence was rare amongst the Lurrians. Lurrian slaves could fetch between four and six thousand apiece on the Invisible Market.

## **History**
The Lurrians had developed the art of bioengineering entirely on their own and had bred numerous genetically engineered organisms on their world. Despite their talent, they preferred to remain on their homeworld, and many did not take part in contracts for genetic research with outsiders. After the Clone Wars ended, they were one of a number of species that were enslaved by the Galactic Empire. Once this was done, the Empire placed a number of rigid restrictions on cloning and genetic research, though not everyone was happy with these imposed laws.[
