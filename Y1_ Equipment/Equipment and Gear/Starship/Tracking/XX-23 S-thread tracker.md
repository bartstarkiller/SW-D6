**Background**
The XX-23 S-thread tracker, also known as the XX-23 S-Thread Tracer, was a homing beacon developed by Sienar Fleet Systems to track ships through hyperspace to their destination. The tracker was able to be launched from the warhead launcher of a TIE Advanced v1 starfighter and was used by the Grand Inquisitor to track the Ghost. Four years later, another XX-23 was used to track the Millennium Falcon to Yavin 4, which allowed the Empire to discover the secret rebel base there.
