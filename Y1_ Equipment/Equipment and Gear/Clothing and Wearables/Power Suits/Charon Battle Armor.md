> Humanoids must make a **Moderate** Dexterity roll to twist into the battle armor and a **Difficult** powersuit operation roll to operate the suit. They also have **+2 added to all difficulties numbers** when using the suit to perform an action. A **Moderate** stamina roll must be made every 15 minutes, failure indicating exhaustion and heat prostration. Subtract 1D from all skills and attributes until the character has at least an hourâ€™s rest.
