**Game Notes:** 
The pack is not a true rocket pack in the sense that the wearer can “fly”. Instead, the pack allows the wearer to make incredible leaps, over 200 meters at a time, from point to point. The pack can also be used to slow the descent of a person who is free-falling, allowing a soft landing in most cases.
