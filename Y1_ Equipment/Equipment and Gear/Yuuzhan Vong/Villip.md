**Game Notes:** 
> Created in pairs, these leathery lumps of flesh maintain contact with each other over even interstellar distances. Awakening a villip requires a **Difficult** Knowledge roll to stroke it correctly, after which it stimulates its twin to awaken as well. Each then unfolds along the sole break in its membranous tissue, and puckers its flesh into the shape of the owner of the villip at the other end. In effect, the villip shows its operator the features of the person he or she is communicating with, as well as emulating the voice and speech of its twinâ€™s owner.
