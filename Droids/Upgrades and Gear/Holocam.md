**Game Notes:**
> The TL3 holocam is designed specifically for droids; it is a small processing device that can be tied into the droid’s existing optical modules, allowing a complete first person view from the droid’s perspective (up to 20 meters, limited by droid’s line-of-sight). 
> Images can be downloaded to datacards, dataplaques or holoprojectors, allowing playback and storage of the recording. The basic TL3 ties into the droid’s existing optics, though only human- range recordings are possible.

>For an additional 200 credits per upgrade, the TL3 can be adapted to record with the following improvements: 
>  -macrobinocular hookup (improves range of recording to 100 meters), 
>  -all-environment (360 degree recording, in a 10-meter radius; playback appears as if the viewer is “with” the droid and can look in any direction to see what else is nearby),
>   -thermal, 
>   -motion sensor,
>   -UV hookup

(records in “night-vision” mode with thermal/UV hookups; focuses on moving objects with motion sensor option).
