Maneuverability: 4D+2
Space: 10
Atmosphere: 415;

**Systems**
> [!_1] Defenses
> Hull: 1D
> Shields: 1D+2

> [!_1] Sensors
> Passive: 20/2D
> Scan: 40/2D+2
> Search: 60/3D
> Focus: 3/4D

**Weapons**
> [!_3] 4 Laser Cannons
> Fire Arc: Turret
> Skill: Starship gunnery
> Fire Control: 2D
> Space Range: 1-3/12/25
> Atmosphere Range: 100-300/1.2/2.5 km
> Damage: 3D

> **Notes:** When controlled directly by Ssi-ruuvi cruisers, battle droids use the following skill die codes: starfighter piloting 4D, starship gunnery 3D+1, starship shields 3D+2. When acting on their own - and merely relaying on data back to Ssi-ruuvi Cruisers - Battle droids have the following skill die codes: starfighter piloting 5D, starship gunnery 4D+1, starship shields 4D+2.

> **Weapon Damage:** A single laser cannon does 3D damage. Two or three of the cannons may be linked together to do 4D damage, while all four cannons may be linked for 5D damage. Fire-linking these weapons can be accomplished automatically.

> E**nergy Absorption:** If a battle droid is hit by an incoming laser or Turbolaser blast (does not apply for ion cannons, tractor beams, concussion missiles or proton torpedoes) and the intelligence controlling the shields makes a Moderate starship shields roll, the micro-filament grid has been properly aligned to absorb part of the incoming energy. If this is successful, on the next round an extra 1D may be added to either shields or weapon damage or the droid’s speed can be improved to Space: 11, Atmosphere: 435; 1,250 kmh for one round. If the ship is heavily damaged or worse, the micro-filament grid is overloaded and the energy is not absorbed.

> **Sensor Tracking:** The highly-radioactive exhaust of Ssi- ruuvi battle droids makes them east to track. Enemy sensor operators get a +2D bonus to sensors when searching for and tracking these ships.

> **Notes:** Ssi-ruuvi battle droids are extremely agile and move erratically in combat. The first time a character battle Ssi-ruuvi droids, he suffers a -1D penalty to starship gunnery (or -2D penalty for capital ship gunnery) for the first five rounds of combat. After this period of time has elapsed, the character has “accustomed” to the odd movements of battle droids and can use his or her full gunnery skill.
