**Special Abilities**
**Innate Force Powers:** All Derriphans are Force Sensitive, start out with 6D to distribute among the 3 Force Skills and have access to the following Force Powers, with no pre- requisites limitations: absorb/dissipate energy, sense force potential, lesser force shield, telekinesis, aura of uneasiness, force lightning, control mind, telekinetic kill and memory wipe.

**Probing:** Before it can feed, a Derriphan must enter its intended victim. Accomplishing the Probing requires the Derriphan to make a sense roll; the difficulty is the target’s Perception or control roll. If the Probing is successful, the Derriphan enters the target and attempts to gain control. For obvious reasons, Derriphan prefer to conduct the Probong in privacy, often using its previous host to help entrap a new one.

**Hosting:** Once the Probing is complete, the Derriphan attempts to suppress the target’s consciousness and take full control. This requires an Easy control roll by the Derriphan; the target can resist the hosting with a Perception or control roll at -1D penalty. If the Derriphan rolls higher, then the Hosting has begun. On the second day of Hosting, the victim is entitled to a Perception or control roll at -2D, the third day a -3D, the fourth day a -4D, and so on until the victim is no longer even able to resist. However, if the victim rolls higher, the Derripha is cast out and is at -2D to all skills and attributes for one month. (The Derriphan can voluntarily leave a hosted victim at no penalty.)

**Feeding:** Once Hosted, the Derriphan can now draw sustenance from its victim. The Derriphan drains items in order of preference as listed on the Devouring Chart. Only one feeding can be performed per day; each listed item is equal to one feeding. When the victim’s Knowledge, Perception, Mechanical and Technical attributes reach 0D, the Derriphan detaches itself to search for a new host, leaving behind onlya shattered, catatonic husk. Except in the case of Force skills (which it adds to its own skills), a Derriphan converts what it drains into Dark Side Points. These points are a Derriphan’s literal lifeblood and must constantly be replenished. In order to survive, a Derriphan must expend one Dark Side Point per day. If the creature runs out of Dark Side Points, then it loses the evil (hate, rage, and fear) that sustains it, effectively dispersing harmlessly.
