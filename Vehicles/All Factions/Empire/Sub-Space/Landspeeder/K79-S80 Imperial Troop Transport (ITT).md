Background: The K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport (ITT), also known as the RTT or Recon transport, was a boxy repulsorlift ground assault vehicle used by the Galactic Empire. Developed by Ubrikkian Industries, it was used to either move Imperial stormtroopers in, or to move prisoners out. Despite not being designed for combat, the Imperial Troop Transport was fitted with two forward laser guns, and one dorsal twin laser turret.

The primary function of the Imperial Troop Transport was to move stormtroopers between important locations in times of conflict. A single transport could carry at least one squad of such troops. ITTs were also used to forcibly relocate prisoners, including farmers whose land had been seized by the government. On at least one occasion, an ITTâ€™s side racks were used to transport food supplies.
