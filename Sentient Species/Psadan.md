## Overview

The **Psadan** were one of the indigenous races of the planet Wayland. They were covered with lumpy plates that made them resemble walking, talking rocks, Scientists believe they were evolved from hard-shelled mammals. They were a warlike species and often fought the neighboring Myneyrsh. They were one of the races that the cloned and insane Jedi master Joruus C'baoth kept under his rule at the foot of Mount Tantiss.

When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded, the Psadan and Myneyrsh tried to fight back and were mostly exterminated, the rest fleeing into jungles.
