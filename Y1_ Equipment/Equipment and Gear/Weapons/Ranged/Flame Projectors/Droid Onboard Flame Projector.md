> **Game Notes:** 
> The basic version of the flame projector is detectable with an **Easy** sensors roll or a **Moderate** search or Perception total. The sensor-resistant version can be detected with a **Difficult** sensors roll or a **Very** **Difficult** *search* or Perception roll. A droid equipped with this type of weapon is susceptible to corrosion damage if the chemical tank that fuels the flame projector is damaged. (The chemical does <u>3D</u> damage <u>each round</u> until it is washed off.) Internal tanks can be damaged if the droid is incapacitated. External tanks can be ruptured by stray blaster shots or physical blows; treat them as if they have Strength 3D to resist damage.
