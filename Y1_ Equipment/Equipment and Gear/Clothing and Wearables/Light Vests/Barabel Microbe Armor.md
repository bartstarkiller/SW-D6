> Game Notes: 
> The vest initially gives **+1D** to resist damage from **blaster** attacks to front and back torso. **With each subsequent hit** by a blaster bolt, the vest **goes up by one pi**p (+1D, +1D+1, +1D+2, +2D, etc.) up to a maximum of 3D. The vest drops by one pip for every three minutes the vest is not hit by a blast. If a blast penetrates the vest enough to allow the user to be wounded, the vest is destroyed. If exposed to below- zero temperatures for as little as 15 minutes, the vest is destroyed.
