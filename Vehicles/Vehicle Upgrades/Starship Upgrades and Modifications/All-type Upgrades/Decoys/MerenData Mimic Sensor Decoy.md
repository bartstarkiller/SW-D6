**Game Notes:** 
> Adds 2D to sensor operator’s difficulty to discriminate between the decoy and the real ship. The decoys move up to speed 10, have simple droid brains, and can be issued new movement instructions via comlink or programmed with several patterns. A “false image option” allows the decoy to impersonate any of five preloaded profiles, including the ship of origin, a TIE/ln, a YT-1300 freighter, a Lambda-class shuttle or a Corellian corvette. New profiles can be created with a **Moderate** droid programming roll and the appropriate signal profile.
