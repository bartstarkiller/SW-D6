**Background** 
This TIE Advanced was equipped with a cockpit access hatch, targeting sensors and solar collectors. Its special folding wings allowed it greater speed than the 1,200 kph of a standard TIE fighter. It boasted an armament of two laser cannons and could carry up to 20 missile shells. Unlike the production version of the v1, the Inquisitorâ€™s personal ship also had life support in the cockpit, allowing it to be flown without a flight suit if desired. Unlike most other TIE models, the v1 was outfitted with a hyperdrive and basic shields.
