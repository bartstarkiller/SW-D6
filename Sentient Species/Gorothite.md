**Special Abilities**
**Smell:** Gorothites have a highly developed sense of smell, getting +1D to their search skill when tracking by scent. This ability may not be improved.
**Hyperbaride Immunity:** Gorothites are less affected than humans by the contaminants in the air, water, and food of their world.
**Skill Bonus:** At the time of character creation only, the character gets 2D for every 1D placed in the bargain and search skills.

**Story Factors**
**Enslaved:** Although the Colonial Government uses the term “client-workers,” the Gorothites are effectively slaves of the Empire. Gorothites are offically restricted to their world. Attempting to leave Goroth Prime is a crime punishable by imprisonment. A Gorothite who has managed to escape the planet is considered a “fugitive from justice” by the Empire, to be incarcerated and returned to Goroth Prime if caught (if the Imperial forces who find her have the time and inclination to do so). Gorothites are considered a very minor problem and do not receive the same “attention” as a fugitve Wookiee would.
**Parental Instinct:** Adults instantly respond to the cries of a young Gorothite, whether the child is a part of their family or not. They are driven to protect the child, even if this puts themselves at extreme risk.
**Family Bonds:** Gorothites have a strongly developed sense of family honor. Any action taken by (or against) an individual Gorothite reflects on the entire family. Gorothites would rather die than bring dishonor to their family.
