The Kathol Charr Ontee have 4 fewer attribute dice than their distant cousins, the Charon. The Charr Ontee have been slowly degenerating for centuries. These Charr Ontee don’t divide themselves into the bio-scientist and warrior classes; they have remained a generalist species. These Charr Ontee have no Void Cult (a development of the Charon), and actually consider themselves to have a duty to protect other sentient lifeforms, especially bio-engineered species.
