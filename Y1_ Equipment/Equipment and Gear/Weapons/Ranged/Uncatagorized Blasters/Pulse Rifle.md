> **Game Notes:** 
> Character selects a target: the target and all beings in the cone of fire and within one meter radius of the target take full damage. All targets within 15º wither way of the target take 3D damage. If filaments aren’t changed when scheduled, roll 2D for the first shot after the “change time”, add +1 for each additional shot. On a total of 7 or higher, the pulse rifle’s overload circuits cut in and shut the weapon down, but the overload has caused 250 credits of damage (Moderate blaster repair total to fix). If the total is 100 or higher, the overload circuits have failed and the weapon explodes in the user’s hands, causing 9D damage in a two meter blast radius.
