**Game Notes:**
If a pilot has all the necessary astrographic information on the point of origin and the destination, using an astrogation plotter to get coordinates quintuples the time a nav computer would ordinarily take; it also increases the astrogation difficulty by two levels. Downloading this information into the ship’s hyperdrive motivators requires some kind of jury-rigged interface with a personal computer or sophisticated datapad – a **Very Difficult** computer programming/repair roll.
