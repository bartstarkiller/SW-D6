**Story Factors**
**Clan Rivalries:** Kamar’s various tk’squas often engage in feuds and warfare.
**Cult of the Varn:** A religion has risen among the Badlanders around the holofeature “Varn, World of Water”. Varn has come to symbolize the place where good Badlanders go when they die, unless tempted by the evil Solohan and furry demon pal. Originally a messenger of the gods, Solohan brought first word of Varn, but to the great consternation of the Badlanders, was later flung up into the burning heavens after blaspheming against Varn. A new prophet, Sonniod, has forsworn his friendship with Solohan the Deceiver, and has carried on the word of Varn.
