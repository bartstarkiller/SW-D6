**Game Notes:**
> This amulet consists of a thin silver chain adorned with six dagger-shaped wedges that’s inexplicably heavy. Force-users who don the abattar find themselves able to speak and understand any language, though the strain of the experience deals 2D damage per minute. Force-users with the Alter Force skill can focus the amulet’s energy into a destructive blast. Blast attack is rolled with the Alter skill, has a range of 2-5/10/20 and deals Alter+2D damage. Firing the blast deals a wound on the user and grants a Dark Side Point.
