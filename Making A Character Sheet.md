Acrobatic Tricks. Acrobatics can also enhance brawling and
melee combat attacks. The character must perform the acrobat-
ics trick and the attack on the same turn. The gamemaster
determines the exact difficulty of the acrobatics attempt. The
player may add one-half of the difference (rounded up)
between the difficulty and the successful acrobatics roll to the
amount of damage done (not to the combat skill roll). One
acrobatics trick roll can affect one attack only.

The DI has been manned, since the success of
the Rebellion, almost exclusively by intelligence
personnel from the Rebel Alliance who served in
the intelligence branch during the war and who
have tired of military service. This is only logical,
as most of the scouts were warriors of the Alli-
ance before becoming scouts. As a result, the DI
does have a tendency to follow up "suspicious
leads" that do not necessarily fall within their
jurisdiction-even when they should be turning
over their information to the New Republic's
Secretary of Intelligence. They prefer to "handle
things" on their own quite often, and this has put
them into conflict with the military and the bu-
reaucracy.
