**Background** 
The E-11D blaster carbine, also known as the E-11D blaster rifle, was a blaster carbine manufactured by BlasTech Industries and was used by the Galactic Empireâ€™s death troopers. Very similar in design to the E-11 blaster rifle, it featured a stock and a large-bore reinforced barrel in order to maximize its rate of fire and intensity.
