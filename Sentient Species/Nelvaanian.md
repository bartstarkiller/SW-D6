## Overview

The **Nelvaanians**, or **Nelvaans**, were a race of blue-furred lupine humanoids native to the planet Nelvaan. The Nelvaanians called their planet the 'Great Mother', which they worshiped.

Nelvaanian males became warriors and scouts while the females were builders, gatherers, and raised the children. The tribe was governed by one shaman who claimed spiritual rites within a clan, and one chieftain, elected through a series of religious tests and mutual admiration.

## History

During the Clone Wars, Nelvaan (a planet situated near the Corellian Run in the galaxy's Savareen sector) was the location of a Separatist base run by members of the Techno Union. General Grievous lured warriors from the Rokrul village by having them believe he was a prophesied figure out of Nelvaan mythology, as had been spoken of by their village shaman Orvos. Techno Union scientists then captured them, and physically and mentally altered them into cyborgs for the war.

Grievous, who served as Supreme Commander of the Separatist droid army, had been appraised of the Outer Rim planet by Techno Union foreman Wat Tambor. Upon visiting Nelvaan, Grievous was very much impressed by the similarities between the spiritual Nelvaanian warriors and his own Kaleesh people and, in a twisted form of kinship, he intended to make them his 'new elite', harking back to his earlier days as commander of the elite 'Izvoshra' soldiers of his people's Kolkpravis warrior band. It was General Grievous who thus lured the male Nelvaanian soldiers away from their tribe by making them believe he was the Nelvaan mythology's prophesied figure in order to conduct -- via Skakoan combat engineers using 'unique microelectronics' -- a crude cybernetics experiment upon their bodies. By using samples of 3L41UH7 serum provided to him by the mad geneticist Zeta Magnus, General Grievous was able to create a small army of hulking mutants. But the perverse mutation project was ultimately sabotaged by Anakin Skywalker, who heroically freed the warriors from what otherwise would have been a hideous fate.

After freeing the soldiers in what came to be known as the Battle of Nelvaan, Skywalker, who was referred to by the Nelvaan race as _Holt Kezed_ (_Ghost Hand_ in their language, because of his mechanical right arm), destroyed the Separatist base. Although initially frightened by the near-miraculous reappearance of their warriors, the Nelvaanian females and children came quickly to accept them, joyously welcoming them back into the tribe.
