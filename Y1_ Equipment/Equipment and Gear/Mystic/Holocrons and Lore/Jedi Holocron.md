**Game Notes:**
> Using the information provided by a Jedi holocron will grant a +2 pip bonus to repair and scholar skill rolls that have to do with Jedi-oriented equipment (lightsabers, jedi armor, vehicles, starships, etc.). If a character attempts to convince a “gatekeeper” (ie, the Jedi Master whose personality is imprinted into the holocron) to reveal information, he must roll a **Very Difficult** scholar: Jedi lore skill check. The character receives a +1 pip bonus for every Force point he has, and a -1 pip penalty for every Dark Side point he has. The gatekeeper is nothing more than a construct, and cannot be manipulated by the Force.
