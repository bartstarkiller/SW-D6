> > **Bloodthirsty:** Every being who encounters Avogwi risks death, whether it is because the Avogwi is hungry and sees that being as food, or because it is simply “time for another to die.” Because of this, most beings will avoid Avogwi, which suits the Avogwi fine, but also forces the Avogwi to search out a specimen when either of these two needs must be met.
