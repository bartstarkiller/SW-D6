## Overview

**Rodians** were a reptilian humanoid species native to Rodia in the Tyrius system. Highly recognizable due to characteristics in facial structure and skin pigment, Rodians were infamous for their violent history, which sprang from the difficulties of life in the jungles of their homeworld. Though they were often encountered in the fringes of galactic society as bounty hunters or criminal henchmen, Rodians were not merely simple-minded thugs. The Rodian people produced artists, merchants, and politicians who were found even among the upper classes of the Core Worlds. %% Edited this part to give Rodians a larger chance to be a culture outside of being the ones who'd shoot first or last. %%
