Customizing Holo-colors:
The entries in this Holocron such as Species, Planets, Characters, and Goods all have colored blocks used to organize and highlight their information. These blocks can be customized as a whole by editing their preset colors. 

To edit colors, navigate to Admonition in the settings menu. Observe the custom callouts list, and find the callouts "_1", "_2", "_3", "_4", and "_5".    These are the callouts that are used to color the blocks found throughout this record. By clicking the edit symbol (a pencil), you may open the settings for each callout and change the color to  your liking. Now, throughout all notes, the callout you have altered will display as the color you have chosen. Mix and match a variety of colors to maintain the visual diversity of the holocron, or standardize all callouts to a single color to create a more traditional flat-color hologram look.


**Navigating the Sentient Species Entries**

Use the index in the Sentient Species note, or use the sidebar and scroll through the Sentient Species folder.

If its' planet doesn't contain its name, you know it's going to be better.
