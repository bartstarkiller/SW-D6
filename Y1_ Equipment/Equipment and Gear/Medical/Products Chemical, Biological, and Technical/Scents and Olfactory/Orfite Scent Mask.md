**Game Notes:** 
> The apparatus consists of a breath mask connected by a tube to a small belt unit, which holds about half a liter of water. A small tablet is inserted into the unit and the belt creates a mist that travels up the tube into the breath mask. Scent tablets are five credits apiece, while intoxicant tablets are ten credits each.
