**Background** 
The Preox-Morlana personnel carrier was a class of personnel carrier owned and operated by the Pre-Mor Authority. It was utilised to transport members of the Corporate Tactical Forces to the different territories and star systems under the jurisdiction of Preox-Morlana. During the Imperial Era, one of these personnel carriers was utilized in 5 BBY to transport three teams of Corpos, including Deputy Inspector Syril Karn, to Ferrix. The teams would collectively stage the operation to apprehend Cassian Jeron Andor.

Four Carriers can be detatched from a Corporate Motherstation to deploy to other systems in a sector. In turn, Tac-pod assault shuttles may be launched from Carriers to subjugate different portions of the destination planet.
