^**For entire swarm**. The intellectual abilities of the Fefze are
spread throughout the swarm, not localized in the mind of
one being. **They have 8D for these Attribute Dice**. 

**Special Abilities**
**Hive Mind:** Fefze are a true “hive mind” species. When capable of communicating with other members of the hive mind, they can work as a group. When separated from the hive mind, Fefze act like unintelligent insects.

**Food Production:** Within a time period of one standard day, a Fefze can convert 20 kg of organic material into 5kg of protein paste.

**Acid:** 4D damage, range of 1 meter (uses Dexterity to hit).

**Flight:** Fefze can fly a maximum of 200 meters, but must rest for a minute after doing so. If they do not rest, all actions are at -2D.

**Story Factors**
**Food Producers:** Regardless of their primary employment, most Fefze swarms will supplement their income by producing food.
