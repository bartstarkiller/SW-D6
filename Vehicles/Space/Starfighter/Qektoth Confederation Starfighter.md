> **Note:** Bio-Plasmatic gel clings to the hull of a starship, and continues burning until it freezes in space, or burns off in an atmosphere. While stuck to a ship, the gel does 5D damage for the first round, and 1D less damage each additional round. Resourceful pilots can remodulate their ship’s particle shields to “buck” the gel off the ship. This requires a Moderate starship shields roll, during which the vessel’s particle shields are down.
