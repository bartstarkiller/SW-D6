**Game Notes:** 
> Imperials may make on astrogation roll per hour to track ship. In hyperspace, only the general direction of the ship may be found. Once in normal space, the ship may be tracked to within one parsec. Tracker is too powerful at ultra-high frequencies to find exact location, and system in question must be searched with conventional means. Tracker is a 10 cm long tube. May be easily destroyed if found. In no way interferes with normal communications or cannot be detected by such means.
