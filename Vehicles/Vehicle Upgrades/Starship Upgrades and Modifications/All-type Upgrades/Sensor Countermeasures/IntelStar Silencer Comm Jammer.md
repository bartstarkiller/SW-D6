**Game Notes:** 
> While any ship use their communications array to jam, this communications jammer uses a ship’s transmitters to flood communications frequencies with static. However, comm. jammers have extremely high power demands and can only be used for short duration; basic jammers can operate for 10 combat rounds before requiring recharging (which takes an additional 10 rounds). In addition, for each fire arc that is being jammed, subtract one round from the operating time (focused jamming subtracts 5 rounds from the overall operating time). A ship being jammed must make an opposed communications roll against the jamming ship’s communications operator. The jamming ship gains bonus dice to jam, based on how many firing arcs are being jammed:
