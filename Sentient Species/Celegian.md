> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Broadcast Telepathy:** As their primary mode of communication, Celegians can speak telepathically with any number of creatures within 500 meters. Anyone wishing to resist this telepathic communication must make an opposed Willpower or Control skill roll against the Celegian’s own Willpower or Control skill. This ability cannot be used to “steal” memories or information.

> > **Excellent Swimmers:** Celegian character gain a permanent +3D bonus to their Swimming skill.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > **Cyanogen Breathers:** Celegians cannot survive without their native atmosphere. After being exposed to an oxygen atmosphere for 1 round, a Celegian must make a Moderate Strength check, with the difficulty increasing by +4 for every round past the first. If successful, the Celegian remains conscious, but must continue to make Strength checks until returned to its native atmosphere. Failure indicates that the Celegian falls unconscious, and takes 1D damage. This damage is increased by +1D for each round afterwards (cumulative). Exposure to the cyanogen atmosphere has a similar effect on oxygen-breaters. Celegians outside of their environment exist in transparisteel life-support chambers. These chambers have an effective Body Strength rating of 4D+2 when resisting damage.

%% It would be possible for a developing young celegian to have a tank small enough to mechanize and fit at character scale, like that fishbowl guy from Megamind. %%
