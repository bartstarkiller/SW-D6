##### Overview 
Delphidians were a group of related humanoid sentient species from the Delphidian Cluster, a stellar nursery on the fringes of Wild Space in the Mid Rim, who all had finely striated, dark gray skin with a leathery texture but varied in their other physical characteristics. Some geneticists thought that they shared a long-lost common ancestry, while others believed they were bioengineered as slaves by some vanished master. However, the Delphidians themselves were silent on the subject. The species were part of a brawling confederation founded centuries before the Galactic Republic discovered their stars. The individual Delphidian species spoke many dialects and relied on a common tongue that evolved for trade within the Delphidian Cluster.

Sidon Ithano was a Delphidian who hid his heritage by wearing a Kaleesh helmet. Ithano and another Delphidian, Durteel Haza, were both present in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata shortly before it was attacked by the First Order around thirty years after the Battle of Endor.
