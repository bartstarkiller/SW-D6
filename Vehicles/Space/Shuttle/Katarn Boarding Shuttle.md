> > **Note:** The plasma torch boarding device is mounted on a ship’s airlock system. The controls are just inside the main airlock. Roll the target ship’s hull -2D; if the torches roll scores a “lightly damaged” result, it has breached the hull. Once the hull is breached, the torch requires a full minute to cut a one-meter-wide-by-two-meter-high hole. The extendable boarding tube attaches to the hull and forms and airtight seal in 30 seconds.
