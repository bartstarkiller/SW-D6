**Special Skills**
**Languages:** Time to use: One round. This skill specialization is used to understand and “speak” the unique Anomid form of sign language. Only Anomids and other beings with six digits per hand can learn to “speak” this language. The skill costs the normal amount for specializations, but all characters trying to interpret Anomid sign language without the specialization have their difficulty increased by two levels because of the complexity and intricacy of the language.

**Special Abilities**
**Technical Aptitude:** Anomids have a natural aptitude for repairing and maintaining technological items. At the time of character creation only, Anomid characters get 6D bonus skill dice (in addition to the normal 7D skill dice). These bonus dice can be applied to any Technicalskill, and Anomid characters can place up to 3D in any beginning Technicalskill. These bonus skill dice can be applied to non-Technicalskills, but at half value (i.e., it requires 2D to advance a non-Technicalskill 1D).

**Story Factors**
**Wealthy:** Anomids have one of the richer societies in the Empire. Characters should be granted a bonus of at least **2,000 credits.**
**Pacifists:** Anomids tend to be pacifistic, urging conversation and understanding over conflict.
