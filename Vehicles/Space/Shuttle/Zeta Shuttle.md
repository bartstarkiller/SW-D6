The _Zeta_-class shuttle was a blocky transport that was designed for rapid transit of personnel over great distances and was not suited for combat maneuvers. The shuttle had two large fuel tanks mounted on the port and starboard side, which carried additional fuel and life-support components for long-distance travels. These tanks were designed to be modular, so that empty ones could quickly be replaced at a stopover.

Produced by the Telgorn Corporation, the _Zeta_-class was included in the initial load out of _Victory I_-class Star Destroyers. The _Zeta_-class was retired with the advent of the Sienar Fleet Systems's combat-oriented _Lambda_-class T-4a shuttle.

After retirement, *Zeta*-class shuttles were offered to the general public as a durable, low downtime long hauler popular on cyclical shipping routes.
