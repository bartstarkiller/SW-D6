**Game Notes:**
> All Force-users within 100 meters of the Void Stone suffer a â€“2D penalty to all Force skills. In addition, the use of Force points within the area of the Void Stone is reduced by half (ie, instead of doubling all dice pools, a Force point used near the Void Stone only grants a bonus of x1.5).
