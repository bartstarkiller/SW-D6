**Story Factors**
**Genetic Disease:** Recent generations of Kurtzen have suffered from a degenerative genetic disorder, limiting population growth. While the Bakurans have provided medicine to help overcome some of these disorders, it is unusual for more than two children in a family to live to adulthood.

**Loyalty:** Kurtzen tend to be fiercely loyal to the humans who have provided them with medical assistance.

**Tribal Culture:** The Kurtzen are struggling to preserve their traditional tribal culture. Younger Kurtzen no longer remember the days when nomadic tribes roamed Bakuraâ€™s forests. Elder Kurtzen are attempting to school their children in the traditions of the species, but many are abandoning these teachings in favor of Core World philosophies.

**Developing :** Older Kurtzen are still uncomfortable with advanced technology, preferring a more spartan existence. Kurtzen over the age of 60 suffer a -1D penalty on all skill checks that involve atomic, information or space-level technology.
