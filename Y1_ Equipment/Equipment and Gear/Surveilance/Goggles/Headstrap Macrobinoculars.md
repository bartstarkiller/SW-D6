**Game Notes:** 
> All modes have an **Easy** sensors difficulty at short range, increasing one level per range band. May be used to improve aiming by +2D with blaster or slugthrower weapons (at medium and long range) if the weapon is equipped with a laser-sight. Search and other Perception- based rolls may be increased when using macrobinoculars by +3D when used to find something more than 100 meters away, at the gamemaster’s discretion.
