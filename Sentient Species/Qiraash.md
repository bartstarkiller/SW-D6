## Biology and Appearance

The Qiraash were a sentient species of Near-Humans. They were humanoid—having two arms and two legs—but their pale, pink skin and large craniums set them apart from Humans. The Qiraash head was bald except for curly hair growing from the nape of the neck. Some Qiraash grew tufts of this hair long and wore it in elaborate coiffures. For example, the Qiraash female Leesub Sirln plaited it into a top-knot at the crown of her skull. From here, three smaller plaits ran toward the front of her skull; one each running along the sides of the head and down past the front of the ears, and the third running down the center of the forehead and ending just above the eyebrows. Qiraash facial features otherwise resembled those of Humans with high cheekbones.

The Qiraash were unable naturally to interbreed with members of the Human species; however, with a certain amount of genetic manipulation, such couplings could produce viable offspring. One Qiraash, Leesub Sirln, had limited precognition powers; these were interpreted by High Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne as Force-sensitivity.

## History

The Qiraash were known in the galaxy from at least 84 BBY, when Qiraash Doffen Gaitag oversaw construction of the space station known as the Wheel, which quickly became one of the most popular gambling dens in the galaxy. Gaitag eventually sold the Wheel to the J'feh crime lord Skijid Vrescot, and his granddaughter, Qimberly Gaitag-Delio, went on to become a celebrity attorney nicknamed "the Devourer". At one time, the Hutt Wallanooga—a slaver in the Outer Rim Territories—speculated that his slave Aurra Sing might have been a Qiraash/Human hybrid, despite the inability of the Qiraash genome to account for her longevity. Also during the Clone Wars, a Qiraash served as a bartender at a tavern on the Mid Rim planet Vaced.

A full-blooded Qiraash was the female Leesub Sirln, who was enslaved while only a youngling. During the administration of the Galactic Empire, Sirln encountered High Inquisitor Tremayne, who, suspecting the woman had precognition powers, declared her a Force Adept. The Inquisitorius was charged with hunting down Jedi and other Force-sensitives and either turning them to the dark side of the Force or eliminating them. Consequently, to avoid imprisonment or death, Sirln fled to the remote planet Tatooine, where she hid for many years in the town of Mos Eisley. She was present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in 0 BBY when Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker chartered the services of Han Solo and Chewbacca for transit to Alderaan.
