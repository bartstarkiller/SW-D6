**Special Abilities**
**Force Resistance:** Hutts have an innate defense against Force-based mind manipulation techniques and roll double their Perception dice to resist such attacks. However, because of this, Hutts are not believed to be able to learn Force skills.
**Story Factors**
**Reputation:** Hutts are almost universally despised, even by those who find themselves benefiting from the Hutt’s activities. Were it not for the ring of protection with which the Hutts surround themselves, they would surely be exterminated within a few years.
**Self-centered:** Hutts cannot look “beyond themselves” (or their offspring or parents) in their considerations. However, because they are master manipulators, they can compromise “I’ll give him what he wants to get what I want.” They cannot be philanthropic without ulterior motives.
