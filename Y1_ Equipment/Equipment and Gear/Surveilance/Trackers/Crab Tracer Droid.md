**Game Notes:** 
> Unit is programmed to sneak onto a target and transmit its location though HoloNet with a miniaturized hypertransceiver. Unit possesses the sneak and hide skills at 5D and are remotely controlled. They can be deactivated with a **Moderate** computer programming/repair roll. A crab tracer aboard a ship sends a strong enough signal to be tracked through hyperspace, and grants a +2 bonus to starship attacks made against the tracked vessel.
