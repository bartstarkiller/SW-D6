**Equipment Notes**
**Poison Dart Needler:** This needler gun is loaded with darts that contain a paralytic poison. The darts inflict no damage, but if used against an unarmored target (or an unarmored portion of a target, see the rules for called shots, SWD6, page 91), they inject their poison. The target of such an attack must succeed at a Difficult Strength check or be paralyzed and unable to move for 1D x 40 minutes (40- 240 minutes). No ammunition total is listed, so assume the needler gun carries enough darts for ten shots.
