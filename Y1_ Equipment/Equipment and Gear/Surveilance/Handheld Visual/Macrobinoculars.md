**Game Notes:** 
> All search and Perception-oriented skills are increased by 3D when using the macrobinocular to view areas more than 100 meters away. If attached to a blaster via specialized programming software, they provide a +3D bonus to all medium and long-range shots, provided the attacker is in a steady “sniper” position.
