> > **Jedi Respect:** Barabels have a deep respect for Jedi Knights, even though they have little aptitude for sensing the Force. They will almost always yield to the commands of a Jedi Knight (or a being that represents itself believably as a Jedi). Naturally, they are enemies of the enemies of Jedi (or those who impersonate Jedi). Reputation: Barabels are reputed to be fierce warriors and great hunters, and they are often feared. Those who know of them almost always steer clear of them.
