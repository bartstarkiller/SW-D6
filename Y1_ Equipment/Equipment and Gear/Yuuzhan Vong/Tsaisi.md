**Game Notes:** 
> The tsaisi is a shorter version of the [[Amphistaff]]. When used by a skilled combatant, it can be used as a baton, a two- headed dagger (**adds +2 pips to all parry rolls**), a lash (**adds +2 pips to attempts to disarm an opponent**; successful hits with the lash also inject the target with venom), and a lash-dagger (which shares the qualities of both the lash and the dagger, though the granted bonuses are only +1 pip). Like the amphistaff, it can also spit venom. The venom is injected when a successful hit with the lash inflicts a damage result higher than **Stunned**, and effects are the same as for the amphistaff. Statistics for the tsaisiâ€™s different weapon modes are listed below.
