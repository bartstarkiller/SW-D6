**Special Abilities**
**Clone:** Each Khommite represents generations of perfection in one particular field, and each is at the end of a long line of identical Khommite clones that all share the same expertise. When created, a Khommite character can apply two free skill dice to any single Knowledge, Perception, or Technical skill. These bonus dice do not count against the character’s limit when buying skills during character creation.

**Story Factors**
**Narrow-Minded:** Khommites come from a strict conformist society, where creativity and free thought are undesirable qualities. Although this should be role-played, it also gives any Khommite character a -2D penalty on any skill roll that requires creative action or long-term planning.
