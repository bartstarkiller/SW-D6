> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Natural Armor:** Grants +1 to Strength to resist damage.
> 
> > **Cold-Blooded:** The reptilian Chistori are very sensitive to cold climates. If exposed to extreme cold without proper gear, a Chistori immediately suffers a -1D penalty to Perception when rolling initiative. Ten minutes of exposure causes a temporary reduction of -1 to all attributes. After 20 minutes of exposure, the individual must make a Difficult stamina roll. Success means the Chistori maintains consciousness and suffers no damage. If the roll fails, the Chistori suffers an additional -1 penalty to all attributes. Further exposure means another stamina roll every 10 minutes; the difficulty increases by +4 each time. If the Chistoriâ€™s Strength is reduced to zero, he dies. Once returned to a warm environment, a Chistori that has not already died will fully recover after 30 minutes.

Little is known about the reptilian Chistori. They resemble bipedal lizards, with prominent snouts, mouthfuls of teeth, and beady eyes, and they have a fiercely independent warrior society. The Chistori are a secretive people, and even the Jedi Archives have no record of their homeworld. Like many reptilian species, they are cold-blooded, and like the Trandoshans, they gain a natural armor bonus.
