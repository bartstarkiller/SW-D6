The natives of the planet Carida evolved in a high- gravity environment and have surprising physical strength considering their lanky frames. Their mercantile culture has adapted well to the continued presence of the Empire, and many Caridan-owned industries provide equipment and machinery for the Academy. They see the Empire not as an occupying force, but as a long-term customer. The Imperial policies against non-Humans became even harsher after the Battle of Yavin, however, and caused friction between the Empire and the Caridans for the first time. Caridans average well over 2 meters in height, with long eyebrows and three-fingered hands. Their long, spindly looking legs are composed almost entirely of wiry muscle and end in two-toed, semihoofed feet. Few Caridans ever left their homeworld before its destruction, though a few traveling Caridan merchants may yet survive in the galaxy at large, and a few more survive within the ranks of the New Republic military.
