**Game Notes:** 
> The stun cuffs are passive if the cuffed character does not struggle. If the character does struggle, the cuffs tighten causing physical pain (2D damage). The tightening feature can be deactivated with a **Very Difficult** security roll, but if the roll fails by 10 ore more, the cuff tightens, dealing damage. Deciphering the seven-digit master code requires a **Heroic** computer programming/ repair roll, failure by 10 or more causes the cuffs to tighten. The restraint can be controlled by a remote control that lock, unlocks and activates a stun charge that deals 5D stun damage. Remote has a 50-meter range and can control multiple stun cuffs.
