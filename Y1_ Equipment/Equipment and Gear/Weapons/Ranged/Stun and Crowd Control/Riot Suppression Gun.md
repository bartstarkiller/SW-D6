**Game Notes:** 
This weapon is highly dangerous. Its ammunition is an unstable chemical explosive compound that must be loaded manually every two shots. A character must make a **Moderate** demolitions roll to load the barrels. Failure causes an explosion that inflicts lethal damage to the loader (<u>6D</u>). It takes four combat turns to safely reload a popper, but this time can be cut in half by increasing the difficulty of the demolitions check to **Difficult**. Both barrels can be fired at once in combat, but a **one on the Wild Die** means that the gun explodes, doing <u>damage from both barrels to the shooter</u>. The weapon’s blast affects most targets in the gun’s line of sight, with stun damage decreasing over range.
