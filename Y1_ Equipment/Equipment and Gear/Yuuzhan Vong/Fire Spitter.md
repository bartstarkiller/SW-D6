> **Game Notes:** 
> This implanted organism can spew a stream of flaming biomatter at a single target once every three rounds. On a successful hit, the creature inflicts <u>3D+1</u> damage. If the attack’s wild die results in a “6,” the target catches on fire, suffering an additional damage roll each round until the flames are extinguished. Each time this attack is used, <u>the fire spitter’s host suffers 2D</u> of damage. Alternately, the fire spitter can spray a mist of sticky, flammable droplets over a 2x2 meter area twice every 24 hours. If exposed to flame (from the fire spitter, a blaster bolt, etc.), the film created by these droplets will ignite instantly. Anyone standing within this area is set on fire, suffering <u>3D+1</u> damage per round until the fire is put out.
