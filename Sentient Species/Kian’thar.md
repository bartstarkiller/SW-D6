**Special Abilities**
**Emotion Sense:** Kian’thar can sense the intentions and emotions of others. They begin with this special ability at 2D and can advance it like a skill at double the normal cost for skill advancement; emotion sense cannot exceed 6D. When trying to use this ability, the base difficulty is Easy, with an additional +3 to the difficulty for every meter away the target is. Characters can resist this ability by making Perception or control rolls: for every four points they get on their roll (round down), add +1 to the Kian’thar’s difficulty number.

**Story Factors**
**Reputation:** People are often wary of the Kian’thars’ ability to detect emotions. Assign modifiers as appropriate.
