**Special Abilities**
> **Natural Armor:** Krevaaki possess an exoskeleton which provides a +1 pip bonus to any Strength rolls made to resist damage.

> **Stoic:** The face of a Krevaaki is composed of a series of shifting, chitinous plates with a limited range of expression. During face-to- face communication, it is difficult (if not impossible) for anyone who is not a Krevaaki to read their facial expressions. Krevaaki gain a +2 pip bonus when attempting to make con, intimidation, or persuasion skill rolls against non- Krevaaki.

> **Tentacles:** Krevaaki use their tentacles in the same was as bipeds use their arms and legs. Krevaaki receive a +2 pip bonus on all climbing/ jumping skill rolls that involve climbing, and a further +2 pip bonus to Brawling skill checks made when grappling an opponent. On the flip side, the tips of their tentacles lack the dexterity of a humanoid finger, and Krevaaki suffer a -1D penalty on rolls made to perform intricate work or manipulate small objects.

**Story Factors**
**Xenophobic:** Because Krevaaki are considered a bizarre species by most bipeds, they prefer to conceal their tentacled lower bodies.
