**Game Notes:** 
> If the user stores one hour’s worth of energy, the prosthetic in question gets a +1D Strength or Dexterity bonus for 10 minutes. No more than 15 minutes’ worth of energy (use time; 1 1/2 hour charge time) can be stored by the ring. However, if a complication is rolled while the “charged” prosthetic is in use, the cyborg suffers 4D stun damage due to excessive energy feedback. If user employs the nexus ring more than once per week, have the user make a Moderate willpower roll for each additional use. If the roll fails, the cyborg has developed a psychological need for the boosted energy – if the user doesn’t boost at least once a day, the character’s Strength is considered reduced by -1D. While boosted, however, the character uses their full Strength and gets the +1D bonus for using the ring.
