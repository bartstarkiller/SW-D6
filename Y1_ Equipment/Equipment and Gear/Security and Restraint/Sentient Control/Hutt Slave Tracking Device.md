**Game Notes:** 
> These devices are implanted into the bodies of slaves to prevent them from escaping. If the slave travels beyond the range of his owner’s tracking transmitter, the device triggers a small explosion. The transmitter has a range of 50 kilometers, but can be calibrated down depending on the owner’s needs. The tracking device is most often implanted while the slave is sedated. The device is hard to locate, requiring a specialized scanner and a Heroic security skill check. These scanners are not commercially available. In order to deactivate the tracking device, the tracking transmitter is required. With the proper codes, the required security skill check is **Easy** difficulty. Without the codes, the difficulty is increased to Heroic. If tampered with, or if the slave attempts to leave the transmitter’s range, the slave begins to take damage as the tracking device begins to heat up: 1D damage the first round, 2D on the second, and 3D on the third. If the slave does not rectify his behavior, the device will explode on the fourth round, doing 5D of damage to the slave.
