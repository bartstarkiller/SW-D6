**Story Factors**
**Hive Society:** An individual Kari is little more than a mindless animal. Small groups of 10 individuals can think well enough to tend a farm; groups of around 100 individuals can sovles fairly complicated mathematical equations; the entire plaentâ€™s population can think through problems of abstract philosophy at a far deeper level than most other species.
