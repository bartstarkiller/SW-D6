## Overview

**Veknoids** were a sentient species that were distinguishable by their large under-bites, sharp teeth, slender tails, and fleshy ears that were positioned on the tops of their heads. One famous Veknoid was Teemto Pagalies, a flamboyant Podracer pilot from Moonus Mandel. Pagalies raced in a Boonta Eve Classic Podrace on the planet Tatooine, but his Podracer was shot down during the race by native Tusken Raiders. At least two other Veknoids watched the race from the arena grandstands.
