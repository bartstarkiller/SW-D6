> **Retinal Contact:** These will produce thin plasticizes membranes which replicate the retina pattern of the target to be impersonated.

> **Chemical Security Card (SecCard):** This will store 10 image sheets, which can contain pictures, text information or identification with proper code sequences. The SecCard has no electronic parts. To change to the next identification screen, one presses the “advance” button. Once an image sheet is used the information cannot be retrieved.

> **Flesh Disguise:** These are replicas of the face, hands, and feet of another person. Once fitted into place, the replications are extremely effective at a distance. The mouth of the disguise has a small electronic link to modify the pitch and tone of the voice (if the recorded voice is available)
