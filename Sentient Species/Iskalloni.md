**Roleplaying Hints**
Iskalloni appear calm, as though their thoughts are somewhere else--they always seem to be emotionally detached from whatever they are doing. The Iskalloni are bent on enslaving Human-kind, not out of any particular hatred, but simply because they feel the Humans and the species which associate with them are all weak and worthless. Additionally, the bio-technology currently used by the Iskalloni produces toxic wastes which the Iskalloni must process by hand. No Iskalloni can last more than a few months of constant exposure to these toxins, so the species has decided that it would be most prudent to place less important species in jeopardy. The Iskalloni are quiet and calculating. They do not speak much, but when they do, they appear as if they are being distracted by something going on inside their bodies--as if they are listening for an odd noise to repeat itself. The truth is that the Iskalloni are distracted nearly all the time because they are continually forcing their bodies to adapt to new physical conditions.
