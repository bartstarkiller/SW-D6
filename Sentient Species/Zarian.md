## Overview

The **Zarian** were a species of short amphibious humanoids from the planet Zaria in the Zaria system. Although they remained free on Zaria, they were still under the control of the aristocratic Ancient Houses. The con artist Woetar was a member of this species, as was Alliance to Restore the Republic member Arvee. They were toadlike beings with wide heads, bulbous lips, webbed digits, and brown, slimy, thick, scaly, mottled skin covered in bumpy warts. Due to their slimy skin and small stature, they were hard to get a hold on. They had powerful legs and were capable of leaping great distances, along with natural regenerative abilities. Their coloring could serve as camouflage in some environments. They usually moved by scuttling quadrupedally, and moved slower when they held objects in their hands. Their lungs were sensitive to inhaling too much dust.

The average Zarian stood 1.2 meters tall.
