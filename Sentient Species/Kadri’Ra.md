**Attribute Bonus:** For every 50 years of life, Kadri’Ra may add +1D to any attribute (but may not exceed species maximums).
**Natural Body Armor:** The thick hide of the Kadri’Ra provides +3D against physical attacks and +1D+1 against energy attacks. 
**Trampling:** The bulky Kadri’Ra can inflict STR+1D in trampling damage. 

**Story Factors**
**Enslaved:** Because of their size and strength, Kadri’Ra have been prime targets of slavers. They are often forced to work as living earth-movers or as laborers in large-scale construction projects. Because they can exist in space for limited peroids of time, they have also been used as laborers in space docks. They are not considered sentient by the Empire and are not protected by any type of law. During the time of the Old Republic, there were an estimated 140,000,000 Kadri’Ra living on their adopted homeworld, Arapia. By contrast, when Emperor Palpatine dissolved the Imperial Senate, there were less than 14,000 remaining Kadri’Ra.
