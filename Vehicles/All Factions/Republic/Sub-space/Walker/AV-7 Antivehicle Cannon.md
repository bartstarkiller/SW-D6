**Background**
The AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannon, also designated as the AV-7 mobile gun, the AV-7 anti-vehicle gun, or simply as the clone artillery gun, was a model of self-propelled artillery piece that was used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The AV-7 was manufactured by the weapons company Taim & Bak for a price of 14,000 credits when new, though the price could fall as low as 8,000 credits for used pieces. Each cannon was 15.38 meters in height and was operated by a single clone gunner. Since the AV-7 was a self-propelled artillery piece that was automatic, the gunner was not responsible for the control of the gun, only the handling of the artillery.

The AV-7 maneuvered with a repulsorlift until it reached a desired firing position, after which it would deploy four robust metal legs for ground stabilization, although on occasion it could use the legs to advance. The seat of the gunner was situated next to the gun, although it could be placed on either side. The cannon was a long barrel, which propelled plasma ammunition that had a very wide coverage. Due to the powerful plasma explosion that was produced by the plasma shot, a single shot could destroy several vehicles and all droids nearby. Despite this, it was completely ineffective against deflector shields. Because the Separatist Droid Army was mostly composed of mechanical soldiers, the use of plasma cartridges was advantageous for the Grand Army of the Republic, which could destroy them alongside their vehicles. The AV-7 was recognizable by its silhouette, which was reminiscent of a mechanical octopus with several legs with a long barrel on its upper part.
