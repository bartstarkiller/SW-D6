A vial of Slick houses a greenish-silver liquid that is sluggish to the touch. Slick is an oil made from fermented seaweed from the planet [[Vaynai]] that matches powerful medicinal properties with delirium inducing euphoria- if the imbiber can get past the nauseatingly mucosal texture. 

A single dose of slick can be applied like a medpac in order to treat wounds. Slick causes a euphoric delirium in the patient, and anyone under the influence of the drug must roll a **Heroic**-difficulty stamina check or suffer a -1D penalty to their Knowledge, Perception, and Technical attributes for three hours.
