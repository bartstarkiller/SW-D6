> **Game Notes:**
> If user takes an extra round to aim, he achieves a “target lock”. In this mode, if roll to hit the target fails but is within five of the difficulty number, the rocket follows the target with a “tracking” ability of 4D, moves 300 meters per move and may roll once per round to hit the target, with a maximum range of 5 kilometers. If tracking rolls miss difficulty number by a total of 10 or more, the rocket has lost its target.
