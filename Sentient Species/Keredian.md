> **Special Abilities**  
> > **At Arm’s Length:** Due to the unusual physiology of their lengthy upper limbs, large hands and long fingers, Keredians gain a +1D bonus to climbing/jumping checks that require an extended reach, and a +1D bonus to Strength rolls that involve grip.
> 
> > **Augmentation Culture:** Many Keredians hardwired their brains to be directed into an external ocular lens apparatus. This cybernetic optics system grants enhanced vision, especially at very close range, allowing him to view subjects as small as microcircuitry in clear detail. Keredians gain a +3D bonus to visually-based Perception and search checks made at 0-3 meters range, and a +1D bonus when viewing objects or areas at distances of 3 meters or greater. In addition, if a Keredian devotes one full round to focusing upon a given target or area that is within a distance of 0.3 meters, they are capable of viewing even microscopic objects without magnification. If a Keredian spends a full round focusing upon a particular combat target, performing no other actions, he gains a +1D bonus to any ranged attacks he makes against that target the following round.

## Overview

 Keredians were a species of humanoids whose members were thinly spread around the galaxy. Little information existed about them, including their homeworld. Initially some of the Keredian race joined the Partisans but after the Death Star destroyed Jedha City, they joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic to continue their fight against the tyranny of the Empire. One such member of this race was Cycyed Ock, who used a vibrorang as his weapon. Ruk was also a Keredian who was a member of the Tech Masters. Other Keredians were much more apathetic to the civil war, with a Keredian named Dewi Pamular working as a squiggly fisher along an alien named Freedi Pamular on the moon Narkina 5 in 5 BBY which they visited using an old TUG-b13 quadjumper. Dewi Pamular still shared their species’ hatred for the Empire, though, and happily assisted Cassian Jeron Andor and Ruescott Melshi, at the time fugitives from the Narkina 5 Imperial Prison Complex, escape the moon aboard their starship.
