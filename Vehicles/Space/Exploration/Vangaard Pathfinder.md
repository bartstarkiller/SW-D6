> > **Note:** The laser cannon’s special damage is that for each shot absorbed by the shields, the damage of the cannon goes up by +1. When the shields absorb 3 hits, the generator overloads and shuts down for 3 rounds while it recalibrates. Both the +1 and the overload effect reset to zero after ten rounds automatically. The generator can be replaced for 10,000 credits, however, it then loses its additive damage value.
