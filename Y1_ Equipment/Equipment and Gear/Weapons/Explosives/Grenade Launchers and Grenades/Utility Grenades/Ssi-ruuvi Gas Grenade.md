> **Game Notes:** 
> Ssi-ruuvi gas grenades operate much like their human counterparts. Characters within the blast radius must make a Strength check against the damage value of the gas. Any character knocked unconscious by the gas stays out for 2D hours. Any human exposed to the gas for more than 24 hours suffers <u>3D</u> damage; if a wounded or higher result is suffered, the target suffers a permanent -1 to all Dexterity and Strength attribute and skill checks.
