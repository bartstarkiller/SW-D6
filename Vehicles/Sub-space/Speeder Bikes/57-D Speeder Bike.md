**Background**
The 57-D was a single-seat speeder bike manufactured by Aratech Repulsor Company for reconnaissance and exploration during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. Although it lacked an armament like similar models, it did feature a ground-following radar, inertial-mapping system, collision-warning, and a comlink. The control panel was simple, without distracting extras.
