> **Special Abilities**
> > **Hexapedal:** Ruurians have six stubby legs and receive a +1D bonus to Dexterity to stabilize themselves.
> 
> > **Extra Limbs:** Ruurians have ten spindly arms. The extra limbs give them a +1D bonus to climbing. A Ruurianâ€™s ten hands are capable of grasping and manipulating a tiny object, such as a hold-out blaster. A Ruurian must use two hands to grasp and manipulate a small object and four hands for a medium-size object. They are too small to manipulate large objects effectively.

## Overview

The **Ruurians** were an insectoid species native to Ruuria. They generally avoided taking risks. Their government was the Unified Ruurian Colonies. On the planet Ruuria, the Ruurians' society comprised 143 colonies, and every Ruurian belonged to a single colony for life.

## Biology and Appearance

The Ruurian life cycle consisted of three biological stages. They started life as larva-like creatures with sixteen limbs, large multifaceted eyes, feathered antennae, and stunted wings. At a certain advanced age, they entered the pupa stage, spinning a cocoon around themselves and undergoing internal changes by which larval structures were replaced by those typical of their latest form. At the end of the pupal stage, the Ruurian would emerge as a beautiful chroma-wing. During that final phase, the sole desires of a Ruurian were eating, mating, and fluttering along the riverbanks of their home world.

**Stage One**

They were born as fourteen-legged larvae with each leg having four opposable fingers. First stage Ruurians also had fine, wide antennae on their heads, and large, multifaceted eyes. The larval Ruurians were also the most intelligent, artistic and creative members of the species, and were responsible for running Ruuria.

**Stage Two**

The second stage of Ruurian life was the pupa stage. The larvae spun cocoons around themselves, and were transformed into the third stage of the Ruurian life cycle, the beautiful Chroma-Wing Fliers.

**Stage Three**

The third and final stage of Ruurian life was the Chroma-Wing Flier stage. Stage three Ruurians were simple-minded creatures only interested in eating, flying and mating. They also had no interest in working.

## Society and Culture

For most Ruurians, their final chroma-wing incarnation was an enviable fate. Some of them, however, were terrified by the prospect of changing forever, regarding their metamorphosis as a fate worse than death. Those frightened larvae could get special treatments allowing them not to enter the final stage of their biology.

## Ruurians in the Galaxy

Skynx was a Ruurian who lived prior to Kho Phon Farrus's enrollment at the University of Bar'leth, years before 3 ABY. A statue of Skynx was present at the University. Another Ruurian was the pick-pocket Slyyth, who lived on Lothal during the reign of the Galactic Empire and worked with Ezra Bridger on multiple occasions.
