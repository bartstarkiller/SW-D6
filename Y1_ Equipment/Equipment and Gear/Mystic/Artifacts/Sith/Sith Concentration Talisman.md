**Game Notes:**
> Force-user must touch the talisman throughout the Force powerâ€™s initiation. It grants a 1D, 2D, or 3D bonus to any one Force skill. Affected skill may be changed between uses of Force powers, but not during the initiation of one power that requires more than one Force skill. The amount of bonus is dependant on the particular talisman; weaker ones are more common, while the more powerful ones are extremely rare.
