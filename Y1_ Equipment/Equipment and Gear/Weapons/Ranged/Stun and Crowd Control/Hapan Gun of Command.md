**Game Notes:** 
A successful hit with the Hapan Gun of Command lowers the target’s ability to resist a command from the assailant. The target uses his willpower skill against the Gun of Command’s damage dice instead of Strength. Use the chart below to determine the Gun of Command’s effects:

If the target’s willpower falls to 0D or below, the character will automatically accept any command from the assailant, within reason. If the assailant’s command puts the target into direct harm (like walking off a balcony), the target will “snap out” of the trance, voiding the effects of the Gun of Command completely.
