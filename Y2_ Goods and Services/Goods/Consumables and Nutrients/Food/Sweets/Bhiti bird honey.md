Honey made in nests of the cliff-dwelling Bhiti birds of [[Svivren]]. Bhiti Birds collect flowers for pollen and mix with natural secretions in the matrixed and pockmarked holes of their cave walls, developing into honey for survival during their stasis by the time the Winter Mists freeze vegetative lowlands below. 

While ancient honey gathering often resulted in the destruction of nests, most bhiti bird honey today comes from caring and humane aviaries that simulate Svivren's seasonal flux. Bhiti bird aviaries are prominent in multiple sectors, though those not run by Svivreni are derided as missing an authentic flair.

Some old-line culinarists hold that you cannot taste the primal memory Svivreni spring in bhiti honey unless it has been marbled charcoal by whisper of the mists and feather-warmth  in cave. This end of the season '**black bhiti**' is an extreme delicacy normally reserved for hatchling bhiti at the start of the next spring, with culinarians paying to its reputation for a dram.

Bhiti bird honey is extremely resilient at balancing bitter flavors, especially those found throughout Svivreni flora. It brings out unique and pleasant notes from some of the most extreme bitter infusions, creating a happy export market and homemade culture for sentients' bhiti honey infusions fix. 



Noteable mentions:

The Sydroshu Labs 'Standard Suite' galaxy-wide artificial flavoring syrup flavor ''Bhiti Honey" tastes absolutely nothing like the real thing, except to the [[Chagrian]] scientists who developed it.
