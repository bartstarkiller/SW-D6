> **Special Abilities**
> > **Low-Light Vision:** The Oblee’s lower set of eyes allows them to see twice as far as a Human in dim light (for example, moonlight). Oblee retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
> 
> > **Darkvision:** The Oblee’s upper set of eyes allows them to see in the dark up to 20 meters. Such darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight. Oblee can therefore function quite well with no light at all.
> 
> > **Rear-Hand Dexterity:** Oblee have a third arm that extends backward from their left shoulder. This arm is awkward to use, because it is behind the Oblee, and as such any attack rolls made using this rear hand take a -1D penalty. The GM should adjudicate other penalties (such as penalties to hit objects the Oblee cannot see) on a case-by-case basis.

> > **Diplomats**: Oblee gain a +1D to *persuasion* rolls: They are adept at communication, and can often convince others that a bad idea may, in fact, be quite a good idea.

**Wookiepedia Entry**

## Biology and Appearance

Oblee are wrinkled, heavy-set humanoids with two sets of eyes (one set above the other) and a third arm.  Oblee appear somewhat squat (though their average height is approximately 1.6 meters, they are built strangely) and extremely wrinkled. The easiest way to guess the age of a mature Oblee is through the individual’s skin tone. Young adults tend to be bright pink and mature adults chalky white. As an Oblee continues to mature, his or her skin takes on successively darker shades of gray. The two sets of eyes and third arm are other distinguishing traits of Oblee.

## History

The Oblee species was all but wiped out over a thousand years ago by the darkstaff, a powerful Sith artifact. Shifted into a kind of stasis, the Oblee were slowly drained of their Force essences by the darkstaff, which needed them in order to survive. A few Oblee were “seeded” throughout the galaxy by forces unknown, with the most prominent being the crimelord Nirama, in the Cularin system, who believed they were the sole member of their species. It was only through the intervention of the heroes of Cularin that the Oblee were returned to the galaxy.

The calamity that destoryed Oblis left some Oblee in a half-existence, adrift in the galaxy as spirit shades referred to as shadow lurkers. They would sometimes try to interact with the physical world by sucking the life out of sentient beings and inhabiting their bodies

## Society and Culture

 Oblee are direct in their dealings. They do not tolerate dishonesty, for that is what all but destroyed their species. Oblee are slow to anger, but anyone who succeeds in making one mad has a real problem on his hands. An Oblee who feels he or she has been wronged will often go to extreme lengths to obtain revenge. While Oblee prefer not to fight, they will do so if forced. Diplomacy is always the first option of the Oblee.
 
Oblee are technologically curious, and generally hesitant to trust Force-users. Most tend to believe that if there is a way to accomplish a given goal without using the Force, the non- Force method is preferable.
 
 The Oblee homeworld of Oblis no longer exists. Its remains now make up the Asteroid Belt in Cularin. At its peak, Oblis was a place of technological wonders, and its citizens were diligent and excited. The destruction of Oblee civilization was a great loss to the galaxy, and while bits and pieces of it remain in Cularin’s belt, little of this material has been integrated.
