> **Special Abilities**
> > **Heat Dissipation:** Dashade can dissipate the heat that emanates from their bodies, making it difficult to detect them with equipment that tracks by heat. All checks made to detect a Dashade character who is consciously reducing his heat signature, using thermal or infrared equipment, are made at a -2D penalty.
> 
> > **Force Resistance:** Dashade are resistant to Force powers that utilize the Alter skill. All Alter rolls made for Force powers directed at a Dashade character have their difficulties increased by +5. A Force-using Dashade character who attempts to use Alter-based Force powers adds +10 to his difficulties.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > **Thought to Be Extinct:** The Dashadeâ€™s home world was destroyed, and many assume the race to be extinct.
