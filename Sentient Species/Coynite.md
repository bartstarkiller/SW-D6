**Special Skills**
**Beast Riding: Tris:** All Coynites raised in traditional Coynite
society have this beast riding specialization. Beginning
Coynite player characters must allocate a minimum of 1D
to this skill.

**Special Abilities**
**Intimidation:** Coynites gain a +1D when using intimidation due to their fearsome presence.
**Claws:** Coynites have sharp claws that do STR+1D+2
damage and add +1D to their brawling skill.
**Sneak:** Coynites get +1D when using sneak.

**Story Factors**
**Ferocity:** The Coynites have a deserved reputation for ferocity (hence their bonus to intimidation). 
**Honor:** To a Coynite, honor is life. The strict code of the Coynite law, the En’Tra’Sol, must always be followed. Any Coynite who fails to follow this law will be branded af’harl (“cowardly deceiver”) and loses all rights in Coynite society. Other Coynites will feel obligated to maintain the honor of their species and will hunt down this Coynite. Because an af’harl has no standing, he may be murdered, enslaved or otherwise mistreated in any way that other Coynites see fit.
