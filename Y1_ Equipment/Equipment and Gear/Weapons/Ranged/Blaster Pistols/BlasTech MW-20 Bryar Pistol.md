> **Game Notes:** The Modified K-16 Blaster can be switched from it’s normal operating mode to a “One-shot, One-kill” mode. In this special mode, the blaster builds up a charge and discharges the entire powerpack charge in one shot. This depletes a full ammo capacity and the weapon needs to be reloaded before being able to be shot again.

**Background:** Cassian Andor carried a MW-20 Bryar Pistol, the evolution of the Blastech K-16 Bryar Pistol. Although roughly the same design, the MW-20 included upgraded power packs that gave the user more firepower than previous designs. The MW-20 Bryar Pistol was a model of blaster pistol used by the soldiers of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. Deceptive by design, the MW-20 appeared to be a regular pistol; however, it featured a modified power unit capable of releasing its entire heat source in one powerful blast as secondary fire.
