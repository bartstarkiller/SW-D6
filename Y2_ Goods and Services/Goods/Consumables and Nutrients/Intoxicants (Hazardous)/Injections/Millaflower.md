> **Game Notes:** 
> Millaflowers are used to soothe nerves, but this has no game effect. The extract of the millaflower, however, is a potent tranquilizer. For each dose administered, one Strength roll versus the listed difficulty is permitted. Each successive roll is more difficult than the last, but each successful roll negates the most serious effect that the dosage would otherwise indicate.

> Drug effects last for 10 hours, minus the number dice in the subjectâ€™s Strength rating (ie, someone with a Strength score of 2D+1 would suffer the effects for 10-2, or 8 hours), and this duration does not change regardless of the dosage administered. Multiple doses can be given within a 24 hour period, and will count as additional doses as per the above chart.
