## Overview

 Native to the desert planet Pasaana. They are generally peaceful and hospitable, and welcome offworlders to their planet. The Aki-Aki maintain a pre-starflight level of civilization, but adopt a number of advanced tools to aid in their life on Pasaana. Aki-Aki history is not always peaceful, however; their species faced strife between scattered clans, though they eventually worked together to survive Pasaanaâ€™s harsh climate.
