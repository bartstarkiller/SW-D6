**Game Notes:**
> In addition to displaying course, distance, shield strength, firepower, damage, speed and condition of vessel for all combatants, the BAC has tactics: fleets 5D and tactics: starfighters 5D. A battlefield commander may defer to the machine’s recommendations (use the BAC’s skill for tactics rolls), or the BAC may assist the commander (use the rules for “Combined Actions” from the Rulebook).
