**Game Notes:**
> A code cylinder accesses computer data via a droid’s comp link or provides entry into restricted facilities. Each cylinder features the user’s personal security clearance data and access codes encrypted within them. Code cylinders can be programmed at properly equipped computers by making a Moderate computer programming/repair roll. Without such systems the difficulty is **Very Difficult**.
