**Game Notes:** 
> Chamber provides full cover to its occupant and has a Strength of 5D to resist damage. If destroyed, it releases a 10-meter-radius cyanogens gas cloud that deals a temporary -1D Strength penalty to non-cyanogen breathers in the area who fail a **Moderate** stamina roll each round of exposure. The cloud dissipates in 1 round if not confined.
