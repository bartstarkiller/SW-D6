> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Malaise:** The Servants are congenitally sluggish, and cannot improve skills, although they can be flash-imprinted (see below).
> 
> > **Flash-Imprint Skills:** The Servants, although not very bright, can be taught any skill by a “flash-imprinting” technique used by DarkStrider. Using the technique tends to scramble whatever other skills they already possess and redistributes their skill dice as DarkStryder desires. The flash-imprint process takes one Kathol day. 
> 
> > **Obedience:** The Servants are routinely flash-imprinted to obey DarkStryder. They are not willingly loyal: they just obey reflexively.
> 
> > **No Ta-Ree:** The Yimi are unable to use Ta-Ree.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > The Servants hate DarkStryder. Although they must obey the despot, as per their imprinting, they don’t have to interpret its orders as it wishes, or aid it without specific instructions.

**Wookiepedia**

## Overview

The **Yimi** were a species of sentient, diminutive humanoids with large skulls that were indigenous to the world of Kathol"). They were created by the DarkStryder and contained large brains which were flash-printed with necessary skills. The species was created to be extremely loyal to their creator. Despite their complex brains, they were unable to learn new skills that were not flash-printed. It was believed that the Yimi were crafted by DarkStryder to be twisted versions of the ancient Kathol themselves, as a cruel joke on its own creators.
