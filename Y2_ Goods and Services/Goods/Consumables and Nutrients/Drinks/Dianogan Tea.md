**Dianogan tea** was a steeped beverage brewed from chemicals found in the spleen of the dianoga. It was normally served hot. Dianogan tea was considered something of a delicacy by Muuns, despite the fact that it temporarily stained the lips and teeth of those who drank it purple and black respectively. The tea had a mild narcotic effect.
