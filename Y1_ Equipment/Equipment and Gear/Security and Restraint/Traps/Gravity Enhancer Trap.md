**Game Notes:** 
> The person setting the man trap should make a hide roll to see how well the device is hidden; any potential target making a successful Perception roll will notice the trap. Anyone caught by the trap must make an opposed Strength roll – the man trap’s gravity setting is variable, simulated by allowing the hunter to choose a Strength anywhere between 5D and 15D.
