> **Wookiepedia**
> The **BTL-A4 LP "Longprobe"**, otherwise known simply as the **Y-wing Longprobe**, was a variant of the standard BTL Y-wing starfighter used as a reconnaissance and scouting fighter by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.

> The ship was designed so it could better implement the longer-duration missions of the profile of the BTL Y-wing starfighter, such as scouting. As such, the second pilot for the S3 variant, as well as all on-board life and mission support equipment, were removed to allow for this. Because of the consequentially lighter frame, the ship could handle heavier payloads as a substitute for better avionics equipment or weapons-fit out and payloads. In addition, although the turret at the cockpit was retained, it has been changed to save on lightness and locked in the forward firing position.
