**Background**
The Max-7 Rono freighter, sometimes referred to as simply a Rono, was a class of box freighter used during the Imperial Era. Cassian Andor flew a custom-made Max-7 Rono could be launched from a ramp that had a track and overhead rail. The weight had to be calibrated before launch so the adjusted thrust ratio could be calculated and allow takeoff. The weight could be determined via a load clutch handle that was next to the booster throttle, which would display the weight on a gauge.
