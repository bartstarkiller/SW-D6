## Biology and Appearance

The **Seikoshans** were sapients indigenous to Seikosha. They were very tall humanoids with pale green skin and unblinking red eyes. They were hairless but for a small amount of black hair on the top of their heads as well as shallow crenelations from the bridge of their nose to their cranium. They also had two-toed feet.
