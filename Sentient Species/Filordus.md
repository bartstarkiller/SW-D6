**Special Abilities**
**Large Ears:** Because of their large ears, Filordi gain a +1D bonus to all search skill checks that involve their sense of hearing. They are more susceptible to sonic attacks, and suffer a –2 pip penalty to all Strength rolls made to resist the effects of sonic weapons and attacks.
**Pincers:** Filordi possess two pincers, one on either of their back legs. These pincers can be used in hand to hand combat, and inflict STR+2 damage.

**Story Factors**
**Asexual:** Filordi are asexual, and reproduce when dying. A week following a filordi’s death, an infant Filordi will crawl from the corpse of its parent.
**Shortsighted:** Although driven to succeed, Filordi are nearly incapable of long-term planning. In order to survive, they tend to consume every bit of any resource that they come across.
