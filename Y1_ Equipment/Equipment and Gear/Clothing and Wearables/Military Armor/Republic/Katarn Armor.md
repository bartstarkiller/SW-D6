**Game Notes:**

> **Armor Protection:** **+2D physical and energy**, -**1D Dexterity** and related skills.

> **Comlink:** Tongue-activated helmet comlink.

> **Retractable Vibroblade:** Concealed in right gauntlet, does STR+1D+2 damage, uses melee combat skill. May be set to automatically spring out every time the user punches something, in which case it uses the brawling skill. Sealed Body Glove: Climate controlled body glove and breath filter allows operation in uncomfortably cold or warm climates and limited protection in toxic-air environments. Sealed suit allows up to five minutes exposure to the vacuum of space.

> **Auto-Bacta Injectors:** When the wearer suffers a Wounded or worse injury, the system automatically injects bacta on the affected area. This does not actually heal the wound, but reduces the injury penalty by 1D (and keeps an Incapacitated character awake, as if he was only Wounded Twice). Unit has a single charge; multiple bacta injections grant no further benefits.

> **MFTAS:** Multi-Frequency Targeting Acquisition System; adds +2D to Perception and search checks in low-visibility situations, +1D to ranged weapon skill uses against targets moving more than 10 meters per round; polarized lenses prevent flash-blinding.

> **Viewplate:** Macrobinocular imaging set (50-100/200/500 meters range) with UV nightvision (See MFTAS, above).

> **Utility Belt:** High-tension wire, grappling hooks, spare blaster power packs, ion flares, concentrated rations, spare comlink, water packs, 2 medpacs, additional supplies pouches
