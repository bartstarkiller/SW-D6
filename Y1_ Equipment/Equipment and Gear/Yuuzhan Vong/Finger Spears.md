> **Game Notes:** 
> The “fingers” of these implants are actually tentacles that can telescope out to a distance of up to 4 meters, impaling targets. A Yuuzhan Vong using finger spears can attack more than one opponent at the same time (by spreading his fingers), but each opponent targeted requires a separate to-hit roll.
