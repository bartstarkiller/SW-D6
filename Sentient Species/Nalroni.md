## Biology and Appearance
The Nalroni were a race of furred humanoids with canine features including pointed snouts and sharp teeth. Originally a predatory species, the Celanite Nalroni used their hunting instincts to become skilled traders and negotiators. Nalroni could contract diseases to which Mon Calamari were immune.

## Society and Culture

Nearly all Celanites were merchants who lived in the sprawling walled metropolis of Celanon City. In addition to commercial profits, tariffs and bribes from all offworld trade going through Celanon City made the Celanites quite wealthy. Their merchant guilds and trading companies were among the wealthiest and most influential in their sector. Celanites wore the most ornate and expensive clothing they could afford, as a mark of their status. Celanites considered their trading guilds to be more important than family or tribe.

The vast majority of Nalroni lived rural lifestyles, organized in clans and tribes. Though they modified their traditional lifestyles to use droid labor and Imperial-supplied prefabricated housing, they were suspicious of offworld influence. The merchant guilds who ruled Celanon were sensitive to these concerns, and allowed few offworlders outside Celanon City's walls. They also made sure to distribute the wealth of Celanon City to the tribes, and limited the number of young rural Nalroni who were allowed to leave their tribe to become merchants. While the rural tribes were sometimes suspicious of the Celanites' excesses and offworld influence, they appreciated the conveniences Celanon City's prosperity gave them.

Nalroni architecture consisted of wood, clay and grass, with natural clay pottery and earthenware for dining.
