**Wookiepedia**

The **Saurtons** were a sentient species of reptiles indigenous to the planet [[Essowyn]].

Often gold-skinned, these bipedal reptiles usually stood nearly two meters tall. Saurtons were quick, and had terrible tempers, often coaxing others into fights. Although resistant to disease, these creatures could be carriers of many dangerous bacteria. As such, visitors to the planet Essowyn had to take extra precautions to stay healthy, as Saurton cities had a high level of filth.

Because Essowyn had such an abundance of metal, Saurton were able to create advanced technology, including radio-wave transmission devices, projectile weapons, and advanced manufacturing machinery. After a Galactic Republic expedition discovered the planet, the Saurtons adapted to more advanced technologies, becoming on par with most galactic civilizations.
