Special Abilities
**Swimming:** Anguilla are natural swimmers and receive +3D to all swimming rolls.
**Slippery Skin:** Because of their slippery skin, all brawling rolls (including grappling attacks) against Anguilla are at a +10 penalty.
**Bite:** STR+1D damage.
**Vision:** Anguilla can see in the infrared spectrum, allowing them to see in complete darkness provided there are heat sources. They suffer no penalties in darkness.
**Enhanced Senses:** Anguilla have an incredible sense of smell when in Alluuvia’s oceans. With an Easy search or Perception total, they can detect predators up to 300 meters away and they can detect Imperials and their vehicles (because of their “alien” scent) up to two kilometers away. They lose this bonus when out of water.

**Story Factors**
**Developing:** The Anguilla are technologically developing and do not know skills that rely on advanced technology.
**Languages:** Anguilla have learned only a few basic words; some Anguilla know the Ithorian language fairly well. They
have a natural aptitude for languages and with an **Easy** languages roll, they can understand the gist of a statement.
Those trying to understand an Anguilla need a **Moderate** languages roll.
