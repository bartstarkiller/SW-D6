**Game Notes:** 
> This personal energy shield is held and wielded much like a normal shield. The user makes a melee parry skill roll to deflect incoming attacks, be they from melee weapons or blasters. Success indicates that the shield takes the damage. The shield has a Strength of 5D. If the damage roll is greater than the shieldâ€™s Strength roll, excess damage affects the shield bearer. Every time the shield is compromised, the protection value is reduced by 1D.
