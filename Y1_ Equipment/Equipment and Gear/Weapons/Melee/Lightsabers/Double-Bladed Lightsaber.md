> **Game Notes:** 
> Proper use of a double-bladed lightsaber requires the specialization “Lightsaber: Double-Bladed Lightsaber.” Without the proper specialization, the difficulty to use a double-bladed lightsaber is one grade higher than normal (ie, **Very Difficult**), and none of the special benefits of the double-bladed lightsaber may be used. If used with only a single blade projected, a double-bladed lightsaber is treated as if it were a normal lightsaber. If properly trained, a Jedi wielding a double-bladed lightsaber gains a **+5 bonus to all parry rolls made when both lightsaber blades are extended**. If an attacking character **misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points** (the base difficulty; not their opponent’s parry total), the character has **injured themself** with the lightsaber. Apply normal damage to the character wielding the lightsaber.
