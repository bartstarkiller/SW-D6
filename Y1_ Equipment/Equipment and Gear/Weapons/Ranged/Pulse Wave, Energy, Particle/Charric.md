> **Game Notes:** 
> Not a blaster, but a weapon firing a maser-guided particle discharge that delivers both kinetic and thermal energy. Ceramic and polymer-based armor is useless against charrics, and characters wearing such armor do not add its bonus to Strength rolls to resist damage from them. While metal armor is effective against charrics, contact creates an electrical charge (treat damage from a charric against someone in metal armor as if the charric had been set to “stun”). Some charrics do have a stun setting.
