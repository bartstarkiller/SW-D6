**Background**
An energy slingshot was a small wrist-mounted weapon that fired non-lethal energy pellets projectiles. They were legal on most planets throughout the galaxy. Ezra Bridger, a teenage orphan from Lothal, used an energy slingshot.

A wrist-mounted slingshot device favored by pranksters and the youth of many species, the energy slingshot was used by pointing the device at a target and pulling back on an energized cup. The cup launched a disorienting shock burst over a short distance when released. A non-lethal tool, it was legal to possess on most worlds throughout the galaxy. Unlike stun blaster bolts, the slingshot projectiles were subject to gravitation and traveled in a parabolic arc.

The slingshots could be modified to send out light only in order to trigger sensors.
