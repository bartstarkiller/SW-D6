**Game Notes:** 
> Using the Nav-Computer Route Astrogation Bypass (N-CRAB) requires three astrogation rolls. 
> The first is programming into the N-CRAB a duplicate of the original course (one difficulty level lower than the original course difficulty). 
> The second roll is to chart a course from an upcoming point in the course to the new destination (the difficulty can vary dramatically, from **Very Easy** to **Heroic**). 
> The final roll is to properly feed the course through the N- CRAB into the nav computer (this roll is one difficulty level lower than the second roll). 
> Missing the first or second roll simply means that the N-CRAB will not function. Failing the third roll by any amount causes a mishap as described in the Rulebook. The whole programming procedure takes one-tenth the time of the new hyperspace travel route. 
> 
> Unfortunately, the N-CRAB has a tendency to interfere with a ship’s nav computer. The nav computer must be “cleaned” via programming (a **Moderate** astrogation or computer programming/repair roll). For a second use of the N-CRAB without cleaning, all astrogation difficulties are one difficulty higher. For the third use, all difficulties are two levels higher. Additional uses incur higher penalties (difficulties above **Heroic** are rated as **Heroic+10**, **Heroic+20**, **Heroic+30** and do forth).
