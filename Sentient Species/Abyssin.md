**Special Skills**
**Survival: Desert:** During character creation, Abyssin receive
2D for every 1D placed in this skill specialization, and,
until the skill reaches 6D, advancement is half the normal
Character Point cost.

**Special Abilities**
**Regeneration:** Abyssin have this special ability at 2D. They may spend beginning skill dice to improve this ability as if it were a normal skill. Abyssin roll to regenerate after being wounded using these skill dice instead of their Strength attribute - but turn “days” into “hours”. So, an Abyssin who has been wounded rolls after three standard hours instead of three standard days to see if he or she heals. In addition, the character’s condition cannot worsen (and mortally wounded characters cannot die by rolling low).

**Story Factors**
**Violent Culture:** The Abyssin are a primitive people much like the Tusken Raiders: violent and difficult for others to understand. Abyssin approach physical violence with a childlike glee and are always eager to fight. However, they are slightly less happy to be involved in blaster fights and are of the opinion that starship combat is incredibly foolish, since you cannot regenerate once you have been explosively decompressed (this attitude has become generalized into a dislike of any type of space travel). It should be noted that the Abyssin do not think of themselves as violent or vicious. Even during a ferocious blooding, most of those involved will be injured, not killed -their regenerative factor means that they can resort to violence first and worry about consequences later.
