## Overview

The **Utai** were a species of short, stubby humanoids with distended eyes that hailed from Utapau. They shared their homeworld with the Pau'ans as well as with immigrated species, including groups of [[Amanin]] and [[Sugi]]. Being the smallest of the two native species, they were nicknamed "Shorts."

The Utai made up the labor class on Utapau, as they were humble by their nature, while the Pau'ans made up the modest patricians, planetary administrators, and politicians. Utai were skilled at creature handling, mechanical work, piloting, and vehicle and starship repairs. The two races, collectively known as the Utapauns, had a symbiotic relationship and lived in cities that were constructed into Utapau's massive sinkholes. Their shared homeworld remained neutral in the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict fought between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic until, in the year 19 BBY, the Confederacy invaded the planet. Feigning acceptance of Separatist rule, the Utai and Pau'ans prepared to rebel.

## Biology and Appearance

Generally short and chubby, the Utai were pale-skinned and hairless, possessing large, oblong heads which sloped backwards. Two glassy black eyes protruded on thick stalks from the Utai's face, which was otherwise unremarkable, aside from a small, puckered mouth. Utai had stubby, four-fingered hands and two-toed feet, possessing dexterity only with their hands. A short-lived race in comparison to their neighboring species, the Pau'an, the Utai preferred to work with their hands and eventually evolved sharp night vision. Omnivores by nature, the Utai preferred cooked meat to raw food, and sought food in the caverns that crisscrossed the sinkholes.

## History

An ancient race of diminutive humanoids evolving on the Outer Rim planet Utapau, the Utai made their homes in tunnels and caves amid the sinkholes that pockmarked their homeworld, colonizing them long before the surface-dwelling Pau'ans were forced to take refuge in the sinkholes after hyperwinds made life on the surface unbearable. Working together, the Utai allowed the Pau'ans to take the lead in all societal matters, although the Utai made up more than seventy percent of the population on Utapau. Introducing the Utai to wind power, the Pau'ans took over governmental work in the sinkholes and relegated the Utai to a labor class.

Despite their role as laborers in Utapaun society, the Utai were not mistreated and remained historically content in their status. Many Utai worked as varactyl wranglers and dactillion tamers, as they possessed an innate ability to commune with animals. While Utai did not have a seat on the Utapaun Committee, they were represented by their city's local Master of Port Administration, a Pau'an, and their needs were generally met.
