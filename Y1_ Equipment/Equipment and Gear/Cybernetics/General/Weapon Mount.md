Type: Cybernetic weapon socket

Cost: 50 (surgery: 2,500) (does not include weapon)
Availability: 2, R
Difficulty: To install: **Easy**

**Game Notes:** 
> The character’s arm end in a socket, on which any range of specially modified weapons can be mounted. Standard weapons cannot be mounted, custom cyber- weapons usually cost twice the normal cost of the weapon. If the medicine roll to install fails by less than 5 points, the weapon fails to operate consistently. Every time a weapon is fired (or every round, if the weapon uses a constant power flow, such as a lightsaber or vibroweapon), if the Wild Die rolls a 3 or less, the weapon fails to fire and shuts off (requiring an action to reactivate it).
