A [[Svivreni]] homestyle favorite. [[zikody | Zikody]] oats and [[Sppleti-umph]] seeds are packed together with [[Bhiti bird honey]], rolled in [[creena cake]] crumbs, and sear-baked at high heat. The Bhiti honey hardens fast as excess minerals burn away to create a light and air pocket filled center.

Fun Tidbit: These grainsticks were originally prepared raw ahead of time and popped into the forges for a quick hot lunch for [[Svivreni]] smiths of old!
