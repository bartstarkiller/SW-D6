**Game Notes:**
> One hour of quiet, uninterrupted meditation with a kasha meditation crystal grants a Cerean a +3D persuade bonus for the next 24 hours. The character also gains a +1D inherent bonus on any single skill roll, provided the character has at least one pip allocated to that skill. Transforming an ordinary, unattuned kasha crystal into a meditative device requires an investment of 200 credits for raw materials, 72 hours of work and a **Heroic** scholar: craft sculpture roll.
