The tsil of Nam Chorios are a mineral-based lifeform that appear as green and purple crystals and grow in large chimney formations. Called smokies and spooks by the world’s Human and humanoid settlers, the tsil are sentient and strongly attuned to the Force. This allows them to instigate electrical discharges and accounts for the high Force-sensitivity of the organic natives of the planet. Most tsil have a peaceful, inert life, adding to the Force- enhanced nature of the ecology of Nam Chorios. There are exceptional tsil with additional Force-related feats and skills, though nothing that would rely on physical abilities they lack.

The sentient tsil were mined by the Loronar Corporation, as their crystalline matrix made them versatile components in synthdroids and needle starfighters. In the early years of New Republic, both the sentient nature of the tsil and Loronar’s atrocities were revealed. Under the auspices of the New Republic, the harvested tsils have been, for the most part, returned, but there are still tsils in the greater galaxy waiting to be sent back to their home planet.
