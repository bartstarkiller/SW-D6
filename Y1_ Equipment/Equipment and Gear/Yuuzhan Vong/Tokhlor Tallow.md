> **Game Notes:** 
> Tokhlor are foul-smelling ticks that are thrown upon the ground. On impact, they burst, spraying the area with oil and mucus. Any character standing nearby must succeed at a Dexterity attribute check or fall prone. The difficulty of this roll depends on the surface that the character is standing on: Difficult if the surface is smooth, Moderate (or lower) if standing on sand, gravel, or similar terrain. Until the subject can get away from the slippery surface, all physical actions suffer a -1D penalty. This tallow is also corrosive, and anyone in contact with it suffers damage equal to 1D, plus one additional pip per round of contact.
