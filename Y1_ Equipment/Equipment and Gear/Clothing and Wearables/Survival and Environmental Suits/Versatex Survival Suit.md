> **Game Notes:** 
> Suit is waterproof and tear and pressure resistant. Micro-capillaried fabric’s insulation fluids protect the wearer from temperature extremes from as low as -30º C to as high as 100º C. Suit’s microcapillaries have a limited camouflage system. By exposing the belt color sensor to the environment’s predominant color, custom tinted dyes will be injected into the micro-capillaries, altering the suit’s color, granting a **+1D bonus to sneak and hide**. Helmet has a built-in comlink, breath mask and glowlamp. Optional strap-on armor provides **+1D physical** and **+2 energy** protection, retaining the same camouflage capabilities.
