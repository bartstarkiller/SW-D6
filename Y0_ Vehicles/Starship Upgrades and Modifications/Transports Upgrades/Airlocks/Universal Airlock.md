**Game Notes:**
> This airlock is made of a durable synthetic fabric over a geometrically collapsible frame. Collapsed, it is no longer than a half meter in diameter, but expands to a 5 meter diameter capsule with a hatch and bag-lock. The bag-lock exits to space, and is pressurized by a high power pneumatic pump. The other exit is a simple hatch, with a multi-lock sealing ring. The pressurized interior leaves the airlock somewhat vulnerable to punctures, although the frame resists instant depressurization â€“ 3D Strength to resist damage.
