> **Difficulty**: **Easy** (short range or half planet). **Moderate** (medium range or full planet), **Difficult** (long range)

Game Notes: A ship may attempt to evade the shield using its sensors to determine where the shields are and move around them. Flying through shutter shields is a **Moderate to Heroic** task even if no attempt is being made to block the approaching ship. If the shields are being actively used to block approaching ships the difficulty is the operatorâ€™s planetary shields skill (typically 4D-5D) against the starship dodge, including scale and other modifiers.
