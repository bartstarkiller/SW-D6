**Game Notes:** 
> A sensors roll is required to use the device; the difficulty depends upon the conditions as described in the sensors rules in the Star Wars Adventure Journal. In addition to providing the number of lifeforms detected, and rate and direction of movement, the unit will inform the user if the body function parameters match or are similar to any lifeforms pre-programmed into the unitâ€™s database.
