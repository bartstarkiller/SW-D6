Model: Imperial Neural Interface Device
Type: Ship neural interface
Cost: 9,000
Availability: X

Game Notes: 
> The neural interface device is wired into the standard control systems of any starship. Four long wires ending in gelatinous diodes are placed on the pilotâ€™s temples and just below the ears. After some initialization, the user can issue commands to his ship simply by thought. 
> A character using the interface must make a Perception roll **every round** against the difficulty listed on the chart below. If successful, any rolls made for the ship are made at **+2D for that round**. This does not count as two actions, as the process is so incredibly fast that it takes practically no time at all.
