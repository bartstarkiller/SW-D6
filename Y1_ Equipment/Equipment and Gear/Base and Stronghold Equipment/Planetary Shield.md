**Game Notes:** 
> Each shield protects a 100 square kilometer area. The shield provides 6D Death Star scale protection. Anything that hits the shield suffers 6D damage; energy bolts hitting the shields make opposed damage rolls, if the planetary shield’s roll is higher the energy bolt is snuffed. If the energy bolt’s roll is higher, for every 6 points by which the bolt exceeds the shield roll, 1D of damage passes through: additionally, the shield system takes damage as per normal combat results. If the shield system is damaged, the system has 5D of backup shields that can be brought on-line with a Moderate planetary shields roll. The shield system has a fire control of 3D. Each shield must have its own power generator.
