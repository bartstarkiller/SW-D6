**Game Notes:** 
> Altering data using the “read only” port as a “write only” port requires a **Heroic** forgery roll. Those using a custom-made input plug need to make a **Difficult** roll, but the forger must first purchase or make his own plug. Cracking the datapad to change documentation requires a **Very Difficult** forgery roll. Don’t forget o factor in modifiers based on the forgery skill description on page 56 of the Rulebook. Failure at most of these rolls often lowers the forgery’s quality. Rolling a 1 on the wild die means the forger has accidentally fried the circuitry and destroyed the datapad.
