## Overview

Sy Myrthians were a species of mammalian gastropods, moving on one large "foot" (similar to the [[Hutt | Hutts]]). They were covered in short fur and had elongated heads.

## History

Once members of the Galactic Republic, the Sy Myrthians were represented by Senator Toonbuck Toora in the Galactic Senate. Shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis, they seceded from the Republic and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Two later served as diplomats on the planet Coruscant under the New Republic.
