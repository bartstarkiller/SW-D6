**Game Notes:**
> In addition to the ability to scan technical files to pinpoint problems, the Intellex IV also supports sophisticated analysis programs, such as the lifeform identification subroutines (LFIs) and many low level scanner tasks. As the Intellex IV’s primary function is to scan technical files and find data patterns, it is very useful to characters who have improved Technical skills and a need to retrieve restricted files and information.
>  A character can use an independent Intellex IV unit as a tool when trying to enter restricted systems or files: computer programming/ repair difficulty numbers should be determined by the gamemaster. If the Intellex IV is part of a non-cooperative astromech droid, a **Moderate** droid repair roll must be made to remove the unit without damage. This procedure usually takes about half an hour to complete. Allied astromech droids, however, are often willing toe execute such operations upon their owner’s request. If attempting to do this with an Intellex V or VI, raise each difficulty one level.
