Rancors use this skill and any of the above specializations
to wield large objects as melee weapons. Most of these
makeshift tools cause STR+1 Walker-scale damage.

**Thrown weapons:** boulders, nets, trees: Time to use:
One round. Rancors use this skill and any of the above
specializations to hurl objects generally considered too
heavy for humans to lift. Rancors throw most objects with
a range of 20-30/50/100 meters. Most objects will do 2D
Walker-scale damage.

**Knowledge Skills:**
**Symbolic writing:** Time to use: Variable. Rancors use this
skill to understand simple commands written by the
Witches of Dathomir. A rating of 4D or higher means the
rancor can write the language as well.

**Story Factors**
**Evolved:** Dathomirian rancors have evolved over thousands of years. Rancors encountered off of Dathomir will most likely not be identical, though it is possible that a similar evolution has taken place elsewhere in the galaxy.
**Domesticated:** Most of Dathomir’s rancors have been domesticated by the Dathomirian clans of the world. These rancors are treated as loved pets, even friends, by their Dathomirian comrades.
