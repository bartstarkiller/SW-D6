**Special Abilities**
**Chitinous Bodies:** Colicoids have a thick chitinous exoskeleton, which can protect them when in combat. Colicoidsâ€™ chitinous bodies give them +1D vs. both physical and energy weapons.

**Roll:** By curling themselves tightly into balls, Colicoids increase their movement by +10. A rolling Colicoid may take no other action that round.

**Story Factors**
**Cannibalism:** Colicoids are known cannibals, and are notoriously unfriendly to outside visitors, and are almost never found outside the Colla system. Very few survive trespassing in the Colla system, as the isolationist Colicoids capture and consume outsiders.

**Vicious Warriors:** Colicoids are feared throughout their sector due to the savagery with which they fight. They are born into a warrior culture which teaches combat and fighting before death. Oftentimes a Colicoid will be aggressive, even if suicidally so, while in combat situations, but remain fully aware of the situation around them.

Likely the species which inspired the [[Droideka]].
