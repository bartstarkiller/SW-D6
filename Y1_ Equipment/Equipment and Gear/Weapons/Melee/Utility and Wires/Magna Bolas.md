> **Game Notes:** 
> When used, the thrower of magna bolas must decide if he intends to stun his target or entangle it. If attempting to stun the target, the bolas inflict a 4D stunning attack if the thrower is successful. If attempting to entangle a foe, a successful hit inflicts 2D+2 damage. The target of the entangling attack must succeed at a **Difficult** Dexterity check or be **entangled**. **Entangled** creatures suffer a **-1D** penalty to all attack rolls, a **-2D** penalty to their Dexterity ratings, and can only move at half of their normal Move scores.
