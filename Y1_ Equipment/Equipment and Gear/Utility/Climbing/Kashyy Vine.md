**Game Notes:** 
These vines are used as ropes and cables. They are generally 1 to 4 centimeters thick, and take damage like any living thing (in other words, they have wound levels like characters do). A Kashyy vine has a Strength dice rating equal to its thickness in centimeters plus one (for example, a vine three centimeters thick has a Strength rating of 4D). This rating is used to resist damage that is applied to the vine. If left attached to a tree, or if soaked in the proper nutrients for at least 8 hours a day, the vines will heal one wound level a day. If a cut vine is not soaked for longer than a week, its Strength dice drop by half and it will no longer be capable of healing naturally.
