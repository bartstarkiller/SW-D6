**Background**
Repulsorpods, also known as hoverpods, viewing platforms, or simply pods, were used by members of the Galactic and Imperial Senates during debates in the Senate Building chamber. After the founding of the New Republic, the use of repulsorpods in the Senate was considered “overly hierarchical”, and thus the pods were reserved for ceremonial functions. They were equipped with repulsors, enabling them to hover towards the center of the auditorium while speaking to the Senate, or rise above to ground to address a crowd.

The Galactic Senate Chamber is the nerve centre of political activity on Coruscant. The huge open area is lined with 1,024 Repulsorpods arrayed in concentric circles, each pod housing a delegation from an important planet, sector or political body. Repulsorpod are outfitted with anti-gravity repulsorlifts, so that when a politician wishes to address the assembled Senate, his or her pod detaches from the wall and floats into the open air in the middle of the chamber. The entire structure is fitted with voice-amplifying microphones and automatic translators, and hovercams constantly flit about to record the proceedings for the official record. Each pod comes equiped with a Sonic Neutralizer that dampens soundwaves beyound ten meters. Many Senators would use this device when having private conversations or negotations on the Senate Floor.

During his duel with Yoda, Emperor Palpatine hurled multiple platforms at the Jedi Grand Master with the Force.
