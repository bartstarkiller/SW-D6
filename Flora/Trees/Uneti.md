―Barriss Offee and Tutso Mara, on the Great Tree

The **uneti tree** was an incredibly rare species of long-lived mildly Force-sensitive tree that grew on the planet Ahch-To. The ancient library, which was built to hold the founding texts of the Jedi Order, was made in the hollowed-out trunk of an uneti tree.

The tree was said to have come from seeds from the very first Jedi Temple. During the High Republic Era, Jedi Master Wishan created incense using the petals that blossomed from the Great Tree on Coruscant which Stellan Gios found invaluable to use during Meditation. By the time of the Clone Wars, the tree was generations old.

%% Uneti originating from a venerable order of force-sensitive Neti monks, who believed that giving oneself back to nature was the highest form of enlightenment within the force, electing to dedicate themselves forever to groves of meditating in tree form.

Upon the appearance of their first white blossoms, the Neti had succeeded- generations of who once were monks were now force-sensitive trees.
