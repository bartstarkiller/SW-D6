> **Notes:** The Delta-7 requires a separate hyperdrive module in the form of a booster ring (the TransGalMeg Industries hyperdrive booster ring). Docking with the ring takes 3 rounds to accomplish, and requires a **Difficult** starfighter piloting skill check (the fighterâ€™s maneuverability counts for this roll). Additionally, the Delta-7 incorporates a specially- designed astromech droid (R4-P series), which is hardwired into the starfighter. **Without the proper droid, the pilot suffers a -1D penalty to his astrogation skill checks**. The droid suffers the same penalty to both its astrogation and starfighter repair skill checks.
