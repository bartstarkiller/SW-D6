**Special Skills**
**Droid Repair:** This skill allows Gree to repair their ancient devices. However, only masters of a device would have its corresponding repair skill. Even so, few masters excel at maintaining their deteriorating devices.
**Device Operation:** This skill allows Gree to manipulate their odd devices. Gree Technology is different enough from Imperial-standard technology that a different skill must be used for Gree devices. Device operationis used for native Gree technical objects. Humans (and simialr species) are unlikely to have this skill and Gree are only a little more likely to have developed Imperial-standard Mechanical skills. Humans using Gree devices and Gree using Imperial-standard devices suffer a +5 modifer to difficulty numbers.

**Story Factors**
**Droid Stigma:** Gree ignore and look down on droids, and consider droids and autonomous computers an unimportant technology. To the Gree, devices are to be mastered and manipulated - they shouldn’t be rolling around on their own, operating unsupervised. Gree don’t hate droids, but avoid interacting with them whenever possible.
**Gree Masters:** Gree place great value on individual skills. Those Gree most proficient at operating their ancient technology are known as “masters.” These masters are respected, honored, and praised for their skills, and often take on students who study the ancient devices and learn to operate them.

%%  What does Commander Gree's name come from? An unusual disapproval of droids, battle + childlike utility? Somehow older than his peers and being called 'ancient'? Being made fun of for looking like a slop elephant?%%
