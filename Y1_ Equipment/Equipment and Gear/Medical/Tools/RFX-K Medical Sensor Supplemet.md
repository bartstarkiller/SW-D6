**Game Notes:** 
> Medisnensors are used to augment the diagnostic scanner of a medical bay. Since they can access the medical database of a standard medbay, they are basically booster relays for the existing system. (Access range from database medical computer is 2 kilometers for military-issue units, 300 meters for civilian units). Anyone using a medisensor receives a **+2D bonus to first aid** checks. However, a medisensor that is not patched into a medbay’s computer only delivers a **+1D** bonus.
