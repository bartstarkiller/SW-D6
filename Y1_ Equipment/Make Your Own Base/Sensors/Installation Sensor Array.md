**Game Notes:** 
> Consists of a central processing computer and over 50 sensor dishes. Includes a powerful full- spectrum transceiver (FST) capable of picking up basic information from as far away as low orbit; this range can be increased by the addition of Sensor Relay Satellites (2,000 credits each). The array also has a dedicated energy receptor (DER) for detecting energy use and fluctuation, and a hyperwave signal interceptor (HSI). A life form indicator (LFI) is available for an additional 1,000 credits.
