> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Berserker Rage:** If a Wookiee becomes enraged (the character must believe himself of those to whom he has pledged a life debt to be in immediate, deadly danger) the character gets a +2D bonus to Strength for purposes of causing damage while brawling (the character’s brawling skill is not increased). The character also suffers a -2D penalty to all non-Strength attribute and skill checks.
> 
> > Due to the Wookiee’s great rage, a character must make a Moderate Perception total to calm down once all enemies have clearly been controlled -unconscious, captured, killed or somehow otherwise physically restrained or stopped. Close friends of the Wookiee can coordinate with the Wookiee to make this easier.
> 
> 
> > **Climbing Claws:** Wookiees have huge retractable climbing claws which are used for climbing only. They add +2D to their climbing skill while using the claws. Any Wookiee who intentionally uses his claws in hand-to- hand combat is automatically considered dishonorable by other members of his species, possibly to be hunted down -regardless of the circumstances.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > **Reputation:** Wookiees are widely regarded as fierce savages with short tempers. Most people will go out of their way not to enrage a Wookiee.
> 
> > **Enslaved:** Prior to the defeat of the Empire, almost all Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire, and there was a substantial bounty for the capture of “free” Wookiees.
> 
> > **Language:** Wookiees cannot speak Basic, but they all understand it. Nearly always, they have a close friend who they travel with who can interpret for them... though a Wookiee’s intent is seldom misunderstood.
> 
> > **Honor:** Wookiees are honor-bound. They are fierce warriors with a great deal of pride and they can be rage-driven, cruel and unfair - but they have a code of honor. They do not betray their friends or desert them. They may break the “law”, but never their code. The Wookiee Code of Honor is as stringent as it is ancient.
> > 
> > Atonement for a crime against Honor is nearly impossible -it is usually only achieved posthumously. But Wookiees falsely accused can be freed of their dishonor, and there are legends of dishonored Wookiees “coming back”. But those are legends...
