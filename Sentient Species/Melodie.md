**Wookie Entry**

The **Elders** were the adults of Melodie society on the moon of Yavin 8. They were formerly Changelings") who had undergone the Changing Ceremony. They resembled mermaids with tails and gills and lived entirely underwater in pools that ran throughout the mountains of Yavin 8, which were home to the species.

Elders were able to surface for limited amounts of time, which they use to communicate with their young or to lay eggs which required the Elder to drag him or herself up by their arms. However, this did not apply to the oldest Melodies whom were not able to surface at all.

Notable Elders included Gyle, Esla, Aragon and Lyric.

A **Changeling** was a Melodie whom was undergoing the Changing Ceremony, an event that occurred on the twentieth year of a Melodie's life. This event involved being immersed in a special pool covered by a blue-green algae which created oxygen through photosynthesis for the Changelings to breathe.

This marked the change from land-dweller to water-breather. The process could take weeks, and the Melodie was vulnerable to attacks from Yavin 8's other predators. The Ceremony was concluded when the gill slits and tail slits of the Changelings were formed, making them adult Melodies, also known as Elders"), and allowing them to live entirely underwater.
