## Biology and Appearance
Sekct were small reptiles that looked like lizards with two large eyes set in the front of their skulls to provide stereoscopic vision. They had no external ears. They had long tails that they used for balance when walking upright. The arms of the Sekct had two double joints, with hands that had six fingers. This made them extremely dexterous and able to perform delicate activities. Their skin could range from a dark muddy brown to a light tan, their skin lightening as they aged. They were amphibious with webbed feet which made them equally at home in the water or on land.

The Sekct were a parthenogenic race, meaning all of the members were female. To reproduce, a Sekct would lay an egg every two years. Due to the volatility of their genetic code, mutations were common and led to the offspring being different from the parent. However this made the viability of the egg very unstable, and fifty percent of the eggs never hatched.

## Society and Culture
They lived a tribal existence, hunting the animals of Marca with spears and clubs carved from animal bone. Each hunter-gatherer band was led by the strongest female called "She-Who-Speaks." The leader was responsible for the Sekct oral tradition called the Ancient Words, an epic poem telling the history of their race. Honor was very important to the Sekct, and breaking an oath or refusing to fulfill a commitment would lead to expulsion from the tribe.
