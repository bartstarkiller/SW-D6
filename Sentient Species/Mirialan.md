## Biology and appearance

Mirialans were a near-human species distinguishable by their yellow-green or pink colored skin and geometric facial tattoos. Though typical Mirialans had green or pink-colored skin, some had purple skin, and others blue. Mirialan hair colors included black and brown, and their eyes could be brown, blue, purple, or green. Mirialans possessed enhanced reflexes and were also incredibly flexible and agile, traits which aided them in activities such as lightsaber combat.  As a near-human species, they were capable of reproducing with humans and having human-Mirialan hybrid offspring. Their natural habitat was desert or wastelands.

## Society and culture

The Mirialan people were deeply religious with a culturally specific understanding of the Force. They believed each individual's actions contributed to their destiny, building upon past successes and failures to drive them towards their fates. A Mirialan would place a unique, often geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they had completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos would thus often act as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was.

Because the more markings brought about a form of status, Mirialan society was stratified and allowed the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans did not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes was incredibly subtle and changed the meaning greatly.

Within their belief system was the view that individual actions ripple through the Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a whole. Because the Force was understood through the notion of the Cosmic Force on a basic level, the cultural significance of the energy was defined as fate. Those who were not sensitive to its call still had faith in fate, and felt that it guided their lives. Mirialans always had a presence within the ranks of the Jedi Order.

Doctor Eckard Lokin, a member of the Sith Empire's Imperial Science Bureau during the Great Galactic War, recalled a shared interest in Mirialan cuisine with his colleague Cipher Twelve during a conversation with the Imperial agent known as Cipher Nine.

## History

Following the Sith Empire's return and invasion of the Galactic Republic, sparking the Great Galactic War, the Mirialans promoted their planet as a safe haven for refugees from the Outer Rim. This surge of victims of war led a large number of Mirialans to enlist in the Republic Military, and others to utilise their abilities in the Force with the Jedi.

At some point before the Invasion of Naboo, Mirial fought in a war against a nearby planet. The notorious pirate Arwen Cohl helped lead the Mirialans to victory.
