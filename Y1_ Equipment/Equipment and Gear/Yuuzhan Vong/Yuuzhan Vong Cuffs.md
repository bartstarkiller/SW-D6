**Game Notes:** 
> These small creatures are used by the Yuuzhan Vong as restraint devices, and are locked around humanoid wrists much like regular handcuffs or binders. Anyone attempting to escape can roll a security skill check, with a **Heroic** +15 difficulty. On a failed roll, the cuffs tighten painfully, inflicting 1D of damage. If attacked, the creature has a Body Strength of 2D, and an armor bonus of +3D. If not killed in a single attack, the creature will tighten its grip, inflicting 2D damage per round until dead.
