**Low Light Vision:** Mantellian Savrips can see twice as far as a normal human in poor lighting conditions.
**Poison:** Savrips inject a paralytic poison with their bite. Anyone successfully bitten by a Mantellian Savrip must make a Difficult Strength roll. Failure indicates that they take poison damage equal to the Savrip’s STR+1D+1, and are paralyzed and unable to move for 4D rounds.
**Reach:** Due to their extended reach, they can attack targets up to 4 meters away with their claws.

**Story Factors**
**WIld:** Because they are a a culture of the wilds and natural world, beginning Mantellian Savrip characters may not place any skill dice in any vehicle operations, starship operations, or repair skills. Savrip characters who are primitive gain a +2D+2 bonus to survival skill rolls, and a +2 bonus on sneak skill rolls. In order to adapt to learning technical skills, however, the Savrip must atrophy some of their wilderness survival skills. The process of bringing a Savrip into the technological world results in a loss of the sneak skill bonus, and a reduction of the survival bonus to +1D+1.

A reptilian species native to the planet Ord Mantell, their sentience was a contentious subject to xenobiologist from the Core Worlds. Often believed to be simply a very cunning non-sentient animal by many Mantellians, the Savrips were technologically undeveloped, and had their own informal language. Preferring to wear homespun clothing and wielding simple tools and weapons, some Savrips had learned to speak accented Basic. Savrips' cultural inclination to combat and their unusual language, were misused by Mantellians to depict Savrips only semi-sentient.

During the colonization of Ord Mantell, sanctioned killings of the Savrip species nearly drove the race to extinction. Many were hunted or exported, and, by the time of the Galactic Empire, few Savrips remained on Ord Mantell, keeping to themselves in the Scraplands. The Warlord Taxer Sundown used the Mantellians' prejudice against the Savrips to blame the murders his organization carried out on them. Savrip meat was also enjoyed by some, such as Baroness Omnino, who, with her son") and the aforementioned impostor Jedi Sundown, planned to breed them for food on Ord Mantell in the years up to 37 BBY. However, this plan failed due to the intervention of Qui-Gon Jinn.
