> > **Damage:** The powerful communications arrays can also be used to jam enemy craft in nearby space, causing a penalty on sensors and communications rolls (-2D for starfighters, -1D+1 for space transports, -2 for capital ships). The same penalty is applied to the fire control of any weapon fired at the communications frigate (although fire control can’t be reduced to less than 0D). The jammer is selective enough not to affect friendly ships, but it isn’t powerful enough to affect space stations.
