**Game Notes:** 
> Energy cage encloses prisoner In a force field with a Strength of up to 15D (unit only applies as much energy as necessary to restrain prisoner, so the energy level is often much tower when not being resisted). Somehow, the cage emanates a special type of energy that blocks Force energies and similar mental energies with an effectiveness of up to 15D. The unit has a special repulsor unit keeping the prisoner suspended in the center of the cage. This bottom mounted unit also supplies oxygen to the prisoner (there are no provisions for food and water; it is presumed that a Jedi will go into hibernation if he or she spends a long time in the cage).
