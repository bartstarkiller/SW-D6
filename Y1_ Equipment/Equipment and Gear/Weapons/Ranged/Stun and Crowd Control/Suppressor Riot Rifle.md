> Game Notes: 
> Not only is this a powerful riot rifle, but it incorporates an underbarrel chemical sprayer that delivers Brix-C stun fluid onto targets up to 100 meters away. All characters within 4 meters of a sprayâ€™s impact point much attempt a dodge roll to avoid Brix-C droplets. Characters who fail must attempt a Very Difficult Strength check, or be knocked unconscious for 2D minutes. The chemical cloud extends 8 meters from the point of impact (with this likely being modified by local wind and weather conditions). Any characters in the aerosol cloud (including any who have already resisted contact with any droplets) must make a Moderate Strength check upon inhaling the mist. Those who fail are knocked unconscious for 2D-1 minutes. Breath masks or full-body armor can protect characters from the effects of Brix-C, and characters wearing both types of protection are immune.
