Model: Neuro-Saav Cyborg/Droid Interface
Type: Cyborg/droid interface
Cost: Normally included with cyborg construct, 600 if installed separately

**Game Notes:**
> Cyborg to Droid interface makes all droid programming rolls one difficulty level easier. Use the computer programming difficulties listed on page 63 of the Rulebook if the cyborg is trying to learn something the droid does not want to share, although the difficulty is one level easier. Interface is standard on most cyborg implants.
