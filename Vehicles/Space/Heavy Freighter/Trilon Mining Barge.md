> > ^Note: While the Heavy Mining Laser was designed for strip mining on planets, it has occasionally been adapted by daring and unscrupulous scouts and pirates as a deadly ship-destroying weapon. If a pilot can “land” it on top of another vessel – or fly right above it – the laser can cut through the hull of most small ships quite easily.
