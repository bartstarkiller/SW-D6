> **Game Notes:** 
> This suit adds +1D to a character’s Strength when resisting damage from blaster attacks as long as the person hit was at the weapons’s medium or long range (blaster bolts disperse slightly over distance, and the minor dispersal at medium and long range makes blaster bolts much easier for the suit to affect). The suit can absorb five blasts before being destroyed. If the wearer of the suit is wounded (or worse) as the result of an energy blast, the suit is also destroyed.
