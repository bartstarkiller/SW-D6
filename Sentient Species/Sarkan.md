## Biology and Appearance

Sarkans were tall bipedal reptiles with broad, tapered snouts, five-toed feet, and five-fingered hands with an opposable thumb. Except for the skull and tail bones, their skeleton resembled that of humans. Their scaly skin boasted a variety of tones, including gray, red, orange, lilac, and green. Many Sarkans had mottled skin.

They reproduced by laying eggs, and grouped themselves in family units called egg-broods.

Sarkan claws were not their most effective natural weapon — instead, trained Sarkan martial artists whipped or bludgeoned their opponents with their thick, muscular tails. Sarkans varnished and painted their claws for decorative purposes.

Sarkans were apparently related to the Barabels, though no conclusive genetic links were known.

## Society and Culture

The Sarkans lived underground, in vast caves where they mined various gems such as aqua jewels and Corusca gems. They were ruled over by a monarch seconded by an advisor. Sarkans typically wore colorful loose robes adorned with gemstones.

According to Leia Organa, no species in the galaxy spent more time worrying about ritual and protocol than Sarkans. What made it difficult, even for seasoned diplomats, was that they frequently came up with new customs, making it hard to keep up.

Sarkans were noted for the wealth of their society, thanks to the mineral riches of their home world. Sarka was the only known source of nova rubies, a gemstone common on Sarka but impossible to find on any other known world. Sarkans often wore loose robes decorated with gemstones. Though valued by non-Sarkan "barbarians", Sarkans actually considered the gems to be mostly useless.

Sarkans were also noted for their excruciatingly complex and protracted protocol rituals. For example, when greeting an ambassador, it was necessary to begin with a greeting in one of the five major Sarkan languages. This greeting had to include the greeter's life story, an account of all of the battles the greeter had won, the value and number of gems mined, and all of the mates acquired in the greeter's life. If a greeting took less than one full hour, the ambassador would either take it as an insult (thinking the greeter considered the ambassador not worth a proper greeting) or as proof that the greeter was unimportant and could be ignored. Diplomatic greetings could take up to eight hours. After the greetings came ritual dances, which could themselves take three hours. Though tailless species were excused this duty, any breach in the protocol of the dance by someone with a tail would be taken as a flagrant insult. Those who violated the protocols of the greetings or of the dances would be removed from an ambassador's presence, sometimes violently.

Sarkan culture originally revolved around a caste structure. As a hold-over of this time, Sarkans in later years almost always traveled in groups of three or more. Lone Sarkans were usually outcasts from Sarkan culture, exiled for some offense committed on Sarka.

Sarkans used a single name. Typical Sarkan names included B'neer, Demesk, Fisuran, Ganis, Jilieren, Melas, Siran, Sonus, Tybellor, and U'vala.

Sarkans valued the natural beauty of their homeworld, especially its dense jungles and its bejewelled mountains. Their few cities were located in complex cave systems, usually near underground hot springs to keep the cold-blooded Sarkans warm at night. These cave cities, while apparently crude at first glance, contained all forms of modern luxuries and amenities. The Sarkan cave networks were also connected to their rich gem mines.

## History

When the Galactic Empire was in power, the Sarkans reluctantly relaxed their protocol requirements when dealing with Humans and while negotiating with corporations with strong Imperial connections. This changed after the Sarkans learned of Palpatine's death. Refusing to countenance any further insults, they quickly reverted to their old standards. In one incident, they surprised a representative from SoroSuub by demanding a formal greeting, and cut off trade relations with SoroSuub for several years when their demands were not met. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, the wealthy Sarkans became one of the more powerful factions in the New Republic. During the Thrawn campaign, the New Republic and the Sarkans were negotiating a shipping treaty. In return for access to Sarkan trade, the Sarkans hoped to have the Republic establish a military presence on Sarka. By 19 ABY, Sarkan traders were seen as far from Sarka as Iphigin in the Core Worlds.

%% **A summary of some events involving Sarkans 
The Sarkans hailed from Sarka, a planet located in the galaxy's Mid Rim. During the Imperial Era, they notably traded their gems with the Galactic Empire, a galaxy-spanning autocratic regime led by Emperor Sheev Palpatine. However, the anti-Imperial Rebel Alliance needed gems for their laser cannon, so they spent months getting the Sarkans to agree to hold a summit. Leia Organa, the Princess of Alderaan and a leading figure in the Alliance, was sent to meet Queen Zil of Sarka. However, due to a rough landing in the Sarkan caves, Organa twisted her ankle, which prevented her from meeting the queen on foot as she was supposed to. Therefore, the princess asked the star pilot Luke Skywalker, hero of the Battle of Yavin, to replace her. Little did they know that Lord Rooz, the queen's advisor, wanted nothing to do with the Alliance, instead hoping that the Empire would help him depose Queen Zil. Despite the advice of the protocol droid C-3PO, Skywalker made faux pas after faux pas, until he drank from the queen's own goblet, the Sacred Chalice of the Caves, and was thrown in jail. Meanwhile, as Princess Leia felt better, she decided to join the negotiations. Lord Rooz attempted to arrest her too on a charge of customs violation, but Organa's astromech droid R2-D2 sprayed fire retardant on Rooz and his men, then shocked a pair of guards, which allowed the princess to escape. Organa and her astromech made their way to the tower prison, released Skywalker, and knocked out an Imperial operative that was questioning him. They then went to the throne room to see the Queen, but Rooz arrived at the same time to again arrest them for breaking into the prison and trying to escape. Princess Leia, however, turned the situation to her advantage. She claimed her rescue mission was actually a celebration of Sarkan culture, a reenactment of how Zil's great-great-great-grandmother broke into the tower to free Zil's great-great-grandfather in a tale of epic gallantry and honor. The Princess also revealed that Lord Rooz conspired with the Empire. Finally, C-3PO remarked that Rooz was standing on the royal seal, which was the greatest offense of all. The treacherous adviser was arrested, and the Sarkans agreed to supply the Alliance with gems from their mines.** %%

## Sarkans in the Galaxy
Though the Sarkans had technology equal to most other cultures in the galaxy, they never developed space travel on their own. Aside from the occasional lone outcast, Sarkans rarely left their home world. Instead, they had the galaxy come to them for trade, setting up luxurious resorts and spaceports on Sarka to cater to the "foolish aliens" fascinated by gemstones.

One notable exception was Melas"), a Sarkan traveler seen on Tatooine in 0 BBY, who was exiled from Sarka for violating Sarkan protocol rituals. Melas was an atypical Sarkan in many ways: in addition to his informality and his taste for the company of non-Sarkans, he was short, and had blue eyes.

%% **Behind the Scenes**
A Sarkan first appeared as a puppet shot and edited into the cantina footage for the Special Edition of _Star Wars_: Episode IV _A New Hope_ in 1997. The new creature, Melas, replaced the Defel Arleil Schous. The Sarkan puppet was actually the same puppet used for Ketwol the Pacithhip, except turned around: the back of Ketwol's head became the Sarkan' face, while Ketwol's trunk and tusks were concealed by the Sarkan's turban.%%
