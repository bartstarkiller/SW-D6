Type: Alien vocabulator
Cost: 100
Availability: 3

**Game Notes:** 
> The mask converts the subtle movement of the anomid’s jaw and throat muscles into synthesized words and phrases. It’s programmed for one language only (usually Basic) but can be reprogrammed to synthesize words in a different language, with a **Heroic** computer programming/ repair roll. A non-anomid needs a **Very** **Difficult** Dexterity roll to operate the mask correctly.
