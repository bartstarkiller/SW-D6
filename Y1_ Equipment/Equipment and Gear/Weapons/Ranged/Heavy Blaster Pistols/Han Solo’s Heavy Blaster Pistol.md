> **Game Notes**
> > **Night-Scope:** Solo’s modified blaster possesses a night-vision scope that reduces Solo’s blaster difficulties by one level when shooting at night (The night-scope requires one round of aiming per shot or no difficulty modifier is awarded.) Motion-Sensor: Solo receives a +1D bonus to search to detect motion when using his weapon’s scope.
> 
> > **Modified Front Sight:** Solo has removed the front sight on his weapon, which gives him a slight speed advantage when drawing his weapon. (+2 to initiative when drawing his weapon; this bonus counts only for the round in which Solo draws his weapon.)
> 
> > **“Palm-Tingler”:** A built in cautionary pulser device warns Solo when his weapon’s power cell is almost empty. Later models of the DL-44 were manufactured with such a device already installed.
