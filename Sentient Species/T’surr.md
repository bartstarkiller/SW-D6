## Overview

The **T'surr** were a sentient species indigenous to the planet of T'surr. T'surr were rarely seen in the galaxy. The species was among the galaxy's most dangerous predators, although their relative scarcity made them less threatening. One of the most famous T'surr was the notorious pirate and slave trader Krayn. Although their level of technology did not meet the galactic standard, T'surr capably used technology scavenged from the ships of their victims.

## Biology and Appearance

The T'surr were a sentient humanoid species of blue skinned and blue blooded predators. Their appearance followed that of most humanoids, with members of the species possessing a bipedal stance with two legs and four arms. Two of their arms ended in meaty hands with either five or three fingers, while the second pair was far smaller than the first and protruded from their upper torso or arms and ended in a crab like claw. The species displayed sexual dimorphism between its two sexes, with males on average standing between 2.3 and 2.6 meters tall, while females stood at only around 2 meters. Males were also physically stronger than females, being solidly built, with some males being able to spin a vibro-ax in one hand like a toy.

A T'surr's head included a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, a nose, and two sets of gleaming red pupiless eyes, with either one set situated above the other or all four eyes in a horizontal line above the nose. Around the eyes and mouth a T'surr's face was heavily ridged, with the creases slanting out toward the fan like sides of the head, which extended into a large number of horns in males. T'surr were capable of growing hair on their heads, including beards, which could be black in color. A T'surr's face was capable of producing expressions of nervousness, amusement, sadness and astonishment amongst others, and when a T'surr was enraged its neck would flush red.

## Society and Culture

T'surr originated from the desert planet of the same name in the T'surr system of the Nuon e Safyd sector, a sector in the Expansion Region of the galaxy. Their homeworld was cold and dark due to its distant star and constantly windblown, with other species finding the high gravity there daunting and oppressive. These conditions created a race of survivors who had little empathy for other beings, making practices like slavery common and accepted amongst the T'surr. Within T'surr society wealth was judged based upon how many slaves an individual owned as well as their quality, with a T'surr with no slaves was seen as worthless and was looked down upon by others.

Male T'surr were violent and cruel in nature, looking down upon weaker species and treating them as livestock to be controlled. A T'surr would use his strength and cunning to control other males of his own species as well as any member of other species, bullying them to get his way. This was not the case when it came to male treatment of T'surr females however, as the female T'surr controlled the species homeworld. Males would anxiously leave the female dominated T'surr, also allowing mothers to raise any children. Upon leaving their home, T'surr were often drawn to violent, predatory, professions, joining forces with powerful bands of pirates, privateers, or smugglers. They liked to keep trophies as reminders of their conquests, often wearing these stolen trinkets on their belts. Their species spoke a language called T'surrese. T'surr names included Datynask, Dyrago, Feyrr, Jeneyd, Reythan, Shyntak and Treykon.

## History

Though they were long present in the galaxy, the T'surr were never represented in any galactic government. The Galactic Republic never allowed them representation in the Galactic Senate because they were widely regarded as nothing more than dangerous, marauding killers. However, some governments, like Sith Lord Daiman's Daimanate, happily used members of the species as Sith troopers"). They were also preferred guards used by the slave traders on Orvax IV.

During the last years of the Republic, a notorious T'surr named Krayn worked as a pirate and slaver. His organization was infiltrated by a Jedi Knight named Siri Tachi, and during her undercover operation, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, also fell into Krayn's custody. Though he was a successful criminal and a powerful fighter, Krayn was no match for Skywalker, who had once been a slave himself, and gave in to his anger when faced with Krayn's brutality. The young Jedi attacked and killed Krayn with his lightsaber.

The New Republic continued the policy of excluding the T'surr from galactic politics.
