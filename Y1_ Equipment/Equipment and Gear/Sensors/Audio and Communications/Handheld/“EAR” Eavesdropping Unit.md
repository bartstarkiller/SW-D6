**Game Notes:** 
> After planting one of the thumbnail-sized bugs on a target or location, the microcomputer unit can pick up its signal within 200 meters, but only in line of sight. Using a headset, the bug acts as a microphone, collecting conversations or sounds and sending them to the microcomputer. The microcomputer records and saves information, both in audio and a hardcopy.
