**Game Notes:**
> Instantaneous reception up to a range of 15 light-years. An Easy to Very Difficult communications roll is required to find specific frequencies (difficulty varies based on organization; planetary customs may be fairly easy to find but Imperial military communications channels are carefully hidden and knowledge of their frequencies is a closely guarded secret). Decrypting scrambled codes or translating from other languages is another matter entirely.
