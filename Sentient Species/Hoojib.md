**Special Abilities**
**Energy Drain:** Hoojibs can drain energy from any piece of equipment, or any being that contains energy of any sort. If the Hoojib is in contact with the energy source, the effects are automatic. A Hoojib can attempt to drain energy from an object or being within 4 meters, but must make a Strength check in order to do so depending on the distance (range: 1-2/3/4). Treat this just like a ranged attack. A Hoojib can drain 1D3 shots or hours of use from equipment, droids, power packs, or other inanimate objects per round.

**Telepathy:** Hoojibs can communicate telepathically with any number of beings within a 500 meter distance. Anyone wishing to resist the communication can resist by rolling Willpower or Control against the Hoojib’s Perception attribute. This communication from a Hoojib is “heard” by the target being in his own language.
