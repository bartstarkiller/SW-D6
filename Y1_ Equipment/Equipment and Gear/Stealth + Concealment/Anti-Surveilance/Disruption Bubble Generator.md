**Game Notes:**
> The Disruption Bubble Generator is capable of producing a small, quiet area of interference to audio sensors. This bubble is generally 2 meters in diameter and can only be penetrated by a Very Difficult sensors roll. The DB generators still in circulation are extremely old and extremely fragile. They should be treated as having 1D Strength to resist damage. If Dropped, shot or handled roughly the DB must roll to resist damage. If the DB generator fails its Strength check, it is destroyed.
