**Game Notes:** 
Using the 12C-A requires an Easy computer programming/repair roll. The 12C-A adds +2D to the character’s computer programming/repair skill when searching for information. The 12C-A boasts faster speeds but lacks the robust and customizable user-side security suite of older 9C models.
