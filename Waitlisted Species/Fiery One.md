**Move: can move any speed up to 1,000 meters per second**
**Size: Varies widely; typically 0.25-0.5 meter radius**

**Special Abilities**
**Energy Form:** The Fiery Ones have no physical form, and thus no Mechanical, Strength, or Technical attributes. They appear to be fairly intangible and are capable of moving through solid objects – even other species – without harming themselves or the object they are passing through.

**Energy Discharge:** A Fiery One can administer a powerful energy shock that will straightforwardly kill a target. This is the last thing the creature does; the discharge seems to destroy the Fiery One and is accordingly very rarely used.

**Communication:** The Fiery Ones communicate simple thoughts and emotions by mental transmission. These messages should not exceed three words.

**Story Factors**
The Fiery Ones want the imprisioned Precursors freed, for unknown reasons.
