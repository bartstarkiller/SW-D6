> **Game Notes:** 
> With a wound or worse, the victim must make a Moderate stamina total each round for 1D rounds to resist the effects of blood loss; a failed stamina roll means the victim is at an additional <u>-1D</u> to all actions until healed. If the penalty equals or exceeds the target’s stamina, the victim passes out and will bleed to death in 6D minutes.
