**Special Abilities**
**Hortek telepathy:** Horteks are moderately telepathic, an ability originally developed to predict the actions of prey. This telepathy works just as the Force power receptive telepathy does, but for Hortek it is a Perception skill. Like receptive telepathy, Hortek telepathy is modified by relationship and proximity. Horteks also use their telepathy skill to resist the telepathic probes of others.
