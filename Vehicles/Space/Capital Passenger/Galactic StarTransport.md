**Background**
A class of large transport was active during the Imperial Era. In 13 BBY, as Han and Qi’ra were fleeing the White Worms on Corellia, one such transport flew through the atmosphere near Coronet Spaceport. Years later in 5 BBY, at least one transport’s wreckage was being scrapped at the north side yard on Ferrix near a Pelta-class frigate, and shortly after two transports landed at a spaceport on Coruscant as Syril Karn travelled to the residence of Eedy Karn following the Ferrix incident.
