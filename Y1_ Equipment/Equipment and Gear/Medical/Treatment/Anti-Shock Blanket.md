Cost: 250
Availability: 2

**Game Notes:** 
> When attached to a medical scanner, computer, or datapad (not included), a shock cloth can prevent shock by administering medication to different parts of a patient’s body while simultaneously stabilizing his temperature. This results in a **+2D bonus to any first aid or (A) medicine skill rolls made to stabilize a wounded, dying, or incapacitated character**. A first aid roll is required for normal application (use medpac rules, but reduce difficulties by one level). The blanket’s medicines must be replenished after one use (normally costs about 20-40 credits).
