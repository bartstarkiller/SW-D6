**Game Notes:** 
> A cargo winch typically comes equipped with 50 meters of durasteel cable, and is capable of supporting 80 kilograms (though the droid must anchor itself; factors such as unstable or uneven ground can increase the lifting difficulty by one level). A heavy cargo winch is also available; it performs much like a standard winch but gives the droid +1D to lifting attempts.
