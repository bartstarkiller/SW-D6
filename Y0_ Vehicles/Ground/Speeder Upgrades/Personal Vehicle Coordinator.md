**Game Notes:** 
> Limited vehicles under 10 meters long and under 10 metric tons. Under normal situations, use of this device adds **+1D** to the appropriate vehicle operation skill. If so programmed by the owner, in emergency situations the PVC will automatically make evasive maneuvers to avoid a crash, granting the pilot **+2D to avoid collision** – but an active PVC will prevent unsafe maneuvers critical to combat driving.
