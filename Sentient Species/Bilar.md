**Special Abilities**
**Group Mind:** The group mind of the claqa only functions when every member can view at least one other member. When claqas are separated, the mental abilities of the Bilar decrease accordingly. The abilities of the group mind depend upon the size of the claqa. The “Attribute Dice” is the total number of dice that must be split among the four mental abilities, while the “Attribute Maximum” is the maximum possible for any of those four attributes.

**Intimidation:** Individual beings find the group mind of the Bilar to be intimidating, so claqas receive a +1D bonus to opposed Perception tasks when their opponent is an individual and the claqa is collected together.
**Hearing:** The Bilars can hear a wider range of wavelengths than can most species, giving them a +1D bonus to Perception tasks involving hearing.
**Infrared Sight:** The vision of the Bilars ranges from infrared to yellow, giving them a +1D bonus to visual Perception tasks performed in full to near darkness, and a -1D penalty to visual Perception tasks performed in full light.

**Story Factors**
**Group Mind:** Other beings are often intimidated by the group mind of the Bilar, resulting in a wide range of reactions, ranging from simple discrimination to extreme hatred. Also, if a single member of a claqa is killed, the entire group mind loses twice the dice for that loss until the claqa can make a Very Difficult willpower roll (one roll per day is allowed).
