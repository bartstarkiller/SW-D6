> Game Notes: 
> Since the crab has to excrete the materials that form its needle, it must be well fed and kept from injury or other distress. Under these conditions, it will create another barb in about four hours. A needler crab can be induced to fire its biotic needle. This is done by tapping it on the back of the shell, just above the air sacks that provide the barb’s propulsion. If the needle hits and causes damage, the target must make a Strength test versus the potency of the poison (4D). Failure indicates that the victim it totally paralyzed for 10D minus Strength minutes.
