Type: Tractor beam weapon

Skill: Tensor rifle

Cost: 15,000

Range: 25-75/150/250

> **Game Notes:** 
> The tensor rifle does <u>3</u><u>D</u> damage for the first hit; subsequent hits to the same target within 30 seconds cause increasing dame: <u>4D</u> for the second hit, <u>5D</u> for the third, etc. Due to the great difficulty of targeting and handling this rather bizarre weapon, double the normal penalty for multiple actions in a round (two action would be a **-2D penalty**; three actions would be a **-4D penalty**, four actions would be a **-6D penalty**, etc.)
