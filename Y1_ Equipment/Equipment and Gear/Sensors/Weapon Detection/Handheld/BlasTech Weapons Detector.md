**Game Notes:** 
> Has a search of 5D to detect hidden energy weapons or adds +2D to an operator’s search: weapon detector skill (the operator must have at least 1D in this specialization to qualify for the bonus). The difficulty depends on how well someone has camouflaged the weapons: simply putting it in a pack is an **Easy** difficulty; draining all the blaster gas, pulling out the power packs, cleaning the weapon of all residue and then disassembling it, and spreading the parts among several pieces of luggage, would be a **Very Difficult** difficulty.
