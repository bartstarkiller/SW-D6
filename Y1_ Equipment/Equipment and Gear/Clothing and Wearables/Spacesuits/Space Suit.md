Type: Typical space suit
Scale: Character

**Game Notes:**
**+1D physical**, **+1 energy**, **-1D Dexterity** and related skills. Helmet has voice-activated comlink. Atmosphere pack can keep the user comfortably supplied with oxygen for six hours of vigorous activity. Fine manipulation is not possible with the heavy gloves. Normal blasters canâ€™t be used, unless modifications involving the removal of trigger guards and addition of trigger extensions are made (an Easy blaster repair task that takes one hour). Characters firing jury-rigged weapons reduce their blaster skill by 1D.
