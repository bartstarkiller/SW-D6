With no mind of their own, the Chazrach are one of possibly many slave races that the Yuuzhan Vong use in combat situations. They have been altered as to be stronger and more aggressive than how they would normally be. Physically, Chazrach resemble small, bipedal lizards withe greyish-green skin. They are controlled with the same restraint growths used on thralls, and have been known to run amok when a nearby assault vehicle was destroyed.
