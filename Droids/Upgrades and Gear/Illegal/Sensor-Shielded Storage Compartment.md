**Game Notes:**
> Utilitech storage compartments can hold small amounts of “cargo.” External “storage packs” are generally magnetically sealed to a droid, and require a **Difficult** droid repair roll to remove. These packs are small (20 centimeters long, 10 centimeters, 8 centimeters deep) and can hold objects (such as a comlink, small blaster, datapad or medpac) that an owner may wish to retrieve later. External compartments are immediately visible but sensor-absorbent material makes it virtually impossible to detect what is inside (requires a **Very Difficult** sensors roll). Internal compartments can be detected with a **Very Difficult** search or Perception roll (or a **Difficult** sensors roll). Most droids of moderate size (1 meter or taller can be equipped with a maximum of two compartments).
