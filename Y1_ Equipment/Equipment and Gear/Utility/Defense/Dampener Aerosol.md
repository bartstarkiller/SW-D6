**Game Notes:** 
> The PD Canister is a cylinder 10 centimeters long by 4 centimeters in diameter; it has three charges. Each charge produces a visible cloud that covers a one meter cubic area. **Any blaster bolt entering the cloud loses -1D of damage.** The cloud lasts for one minute (barring heavy winds or precipitation). Additional charges in the same area have no additional benefit.
