> **Game Notes:** 
> Onboard blasters vary widely; the above stats are average. A basic version is visibly mounted on the droid and can be easily detected. A basic version possesses no sensor-masking or camouflage of any kind (an Easy sensors roll will detect the weapon). A sensor-resistant version is also available, making the weapon much harder to detect; a Very Difficult sensors roll or a Heroic search or Perception roll is needed to find the blaster. (Mounting a blaster on a droid’s exterior is also possible, though the weapon can easily be detected by the naked eye; base cost for such a blaster is 800 credits.) The damage code of the weapon can be increased +1D for every 400 credits the owner spends (maximum of 6D).
