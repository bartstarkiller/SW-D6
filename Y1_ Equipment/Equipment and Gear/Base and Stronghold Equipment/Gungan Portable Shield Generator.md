**Game Notes** 
> This is a portable shield generator used by Gungans. It projects a circular shield canopy that provides protection for everything within a 75-meter radius of the capacitor. Multiple shields can be positioned so that their effects overlap. 
> 
> A shield provides 5D of protection from small, fast-moving objects that produce extreme heat (such as projectiles from weapons fire, as well as lasers and blasters), and restricts the movement of large, slow- moving objects (such as troop transports and tanks). It will not stop the passage of small, slow-moving object, such as foot soldiers, nor will it protect against small projectiles that generate no energy signatures or only miniscule amounts of heat (such as arrows). Each time damage penetrates the force field, it loses 1D from its rating.
