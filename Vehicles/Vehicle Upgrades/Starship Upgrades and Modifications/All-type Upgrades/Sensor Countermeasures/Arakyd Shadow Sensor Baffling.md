**Game Notes:**
> A ship treated with this material adds to a sensor operator’s difficulty to detect the ship. 
> A light treatment adds **1D** to the difficulty. 
> A heavy treatment (a second coat) adds **2D**. 
> Additional treatments are futile, since the treatment does nothing to prevent the detection of engine exhaust, a primary method of detecting ships. The type of vessel affects how well the ship can be “stealthed” – blunt, angular ships, 500 meters or more in length, or more than 5D Hull (either capital or starfighter scale) can only be “baffled” up to **1D** of protection. Slender, rounded off ships (smaller Mon Calamari vessels or the rounded Corona frigates popular with the Ohnaka Gang, for example) are easier to baffle, due to their natural design.
