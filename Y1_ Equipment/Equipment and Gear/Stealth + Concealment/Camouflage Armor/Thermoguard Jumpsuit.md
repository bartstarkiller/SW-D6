> **Game Notes:** 
> This jumpsuit **makes the wearer invisible to infrared detection devices**, and negates the benefits of “darkvision.” Beings with normal sight or darkvision can still see the wearer, though they are subject to normal concealment penalties for darkness (if any). Beings and creatures that are blind without darkvision cannot see the wearer at all. This jumpsuit can be turned on and off, and it takes one full minute to reach the correct temperature. If turned off, its effects fade within thirty seconds. The jumpsuit uses standard power packs, and one power pack is good for two hours of use. The suit is confining, and wearers suffer a -1 penalty to Dexterity.
