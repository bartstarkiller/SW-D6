**Game Notes:** 
> Foot sensor picks up sonic vibration, allowing the character to detect the presence of anything within 20 meters if it’s moving in contact wit the ground. With a search versus sneak opposed roll, the subject can also determine the precise location of the target. Subject must activate sensor and remain motionless to use this ability. If the medicine roll to install fails by less than 5 points, subject suffers a constant -2 penalty to both Strength and Dexterity actions, and can’t move beyond Cruising speed.
