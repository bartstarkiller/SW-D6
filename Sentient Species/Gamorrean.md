**Special Abilities**
**Voice Box:** Due to their unusual voice apparatus, Gamorreans are unable to pronounce Basic, although they can understand it perfectly well.
**Stamina:** Gamorreans have great stamina - whenever asked to make a stamina check, if they fail the first check, they may immediately make a second check to succeed.
**Skill Bonus:** At the time the character is created only, the character gets 2D for every 1D placed in the melee weapons, brawling and thrown weapons skills.

**Story Factors**
**Droid Hate:** Most Gamorreans hate droids and other mechanical beings. During each scene in which a Gamorrean player character needlessly demolishes a droid (provided the gamemaster and other players consider the scene amusing), the character should receive an extra Character Point. %%  not fun after 10 times %%
**Reputation:** Gamorreans are widely regarded as primitive, brutal and mindless. Gamorreans who attempt to show intelligent thought and manners will often be disregarded and ridiculed by fellow Gamorreans.
**Slavery:** Most Gamorreans who left Gamorr did so by being sold into slavery by their clans.
