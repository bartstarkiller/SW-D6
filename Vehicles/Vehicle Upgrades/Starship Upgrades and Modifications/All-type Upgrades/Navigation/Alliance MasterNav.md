**Game Notes:** 
> Alliance MasterNav files can be patched into the navigation system of a starship with an **Easy** astrogation roll, giving a +1D bonus to astrogation rolls for one month (assuming the data being downloaded is accurate). However, if the software is older than 1 standard month, the user suffers a -1D penalty to astrogation rolls. In addition, a 1 on the Wild Die while using the MasterNav indicates a catastrophic navigational error (roll on the “Astrogation Mishap Table” on the Rulebook).
