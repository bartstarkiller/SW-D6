**Game Notes:** 
> Utilitech storage compartments can hold small amounts of “cargo.” External “storage packs” are generally magnetically sealed to a droid, and require a Difficult droid repair roll to remove. These packs are small (20 centimeters long, 10 centimeters, 8 centimeters deep) and can hold objects (such as a comlink, small blaster, datapad or medpac) that an owner may wish to retrieve later. External compartments are immediately visible; internal compartments can be detected with a **Moderate** search or Perception roll (or an **Easy** sensors roll). Most droids of moderate size (1 meter or taller) can be equipped with a maximum of two compartments); smaller droids can be equipped with a single compartment (Utilitech custom- manufactures smaller compartments for the price of an internal compartment).
