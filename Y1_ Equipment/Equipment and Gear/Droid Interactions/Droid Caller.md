**Game Notes:** 
> A caller is a compact, short-range signaling device that broadcasts directly into a droid’s motivational processor (via a restraining bolt). Simple callers can only broadcast simple commands (such as ordering a droid to activate or deactivate). More- sophisticated callers can transmit commands of greater complexity (issuing orders that a droid must obey). The average range of a caller is 20 meters.
