## Overview

This insectile race was native to the planet Vasha, in the Moddell Sector of the galaxy. Each Vashan individual was covered with a chitinous shell, and they were known for their strength and stamina. The internal organs of a Vashan were unusual, especially the stomach. The true stomach was lined with muscle, which the Vashans used to crush their food to begin the digestive process. Six antestomachs preceeded the true stomach, and each was filled with small stones to help break down food as it passed through. When coughed up by the bodhis of the Vashan people, these polished stones were called sin-bullets, and held a special place in the Vashan religion.

 Vashans were known to ignore food until their bodies were at the brink of collapse, at which point they gorged themselves to the point of satiation. Because of this, most restaurants refused to serve Vashan patrons, for fear of the mess they created. As a people, Vashans were timid and seemingly incapable of independent action, traits which were exploited when the Ayrou assumed control of Vasha during the Imperial occupation of Moddell Sector. The Vashans were quickly subjugated and forced to work as slaves in the mines, digging for metals and ores to support the construction of the second Death Star. The vast majority of Vashans simply accepted their fate, bowing to the demands of their leaders.

## Biology and Appearance

The Vashans had a centaur-like structure, with their thin torso emerging from a wide base with four short legs. They possessed two long arms with three fingers, and were capable of fine manipulation. Their heads consisted of two small red eyes set widely on either side of their mouths, which were made up of four small mandibles and two large ones. Their heads peaked into a single large horn.

They were known to be powerful and tireless workers. They also had odd eating habits, and possessed the ability to store items inside themselves, within their antestomachs.

## Society and Culture

Though their homeworld was a de facto possession of the Ayrou, the Vashans ruled themselves through a theocratic caste system.

They were a deeply religious species, and made annual pilgrimages to Inicus Mont, on the moon called Qina. In midwinter, they would repent during ceremonies led by their priests, known as bohdis. These bodhis would cough up gulletstones known as sin-bullets during this ceremony.

Off-planet, the Vashans were prized for their abilities as workers, yet their diet and their proclivity to store interesting items in their intestines was off-putting to some employers.
