> **Game Notes:** 
> When activated, a tzur-qipat releases a cloud of smoke. Each round the smoke expands by 25 meters until it encompasses an area measuring 100 meters long by 100 meters wide by 3 meters high. The smoke confers total concealment to anyone within the affected area. Anyone not protected by a breath mask, a gnullith, or a kavaavik suffers from smoke inhalation. A tzurâ€™qipat has a Body Strength of 6D. Each time it is dropped or struck by an attack, there is a 2 in 6 chance that it activates.
