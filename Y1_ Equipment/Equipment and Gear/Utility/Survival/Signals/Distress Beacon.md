**Game Notes:**
> Transmits personal transponder codes along all major subspace frequencies at a range of up to five light-years. Normal operation is automatic upon activation. A moderate communications roll is required, however, should the user attempt to calibrate the device for non-standard bandwidths, such as Imperial military, government-restricted or Alliance frequencies.
