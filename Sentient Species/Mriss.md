## Biology and appearance

The Mrissi evolved from flightless birds, and retained a light covering of feathers, hollow bones, and vestigial wings on their shoulders. They were a small people, less than half a meter tall on average.

## Society and culture

The Mrissi were renowned throughout the galaxy as scholars. They also displayed a tendency to break from the political mainstream, and felt free to express their opinions despite what others may think.

## History

During the time of the Galactic Republic, Mrissi were warned that the heightened levels of air pollution on Coruscant were dangerous to their species. They were susceptible to diseases caused by the pollution, such as lungrot, dioxo-brionchiectasis shock, silicalung and hemorrhagic molting.

During the time of the Galactic Empire, Mrisst had several universities which, while not as prestigious as more expensive schools, enjoyed an excellent galactic reputation. It was these schools which brought Imperial forces to Mrisst to subdue the sometimes radical, but peaceful, political views of the Mrissi.

During the period of Imperial subjugation, many Mrissi left their homeworld as refugees or wandering scholars. Others were forced to use their knowledge to serve the Empire. Soon after the Battle of Endor, the Mrissi began to enthusiastically support the New Republic.

Despite their intelligence, the Mrissi had an unusual cultural blind spot. Until contacted by the Tenth Alderaanian Expedition, they had never developed the art of sculpture. Grand Admiral Thrawn used this quirk as a starting point to better understand Mriss psychology, leading to the seizure of Mrisst shortly before his siege of Coruscant.[

## Note
Mrissi should not be confused with the Mrlssi of Mrlsst, in the Tapani sector, who were also a small, scholarly race of flightless birds.
