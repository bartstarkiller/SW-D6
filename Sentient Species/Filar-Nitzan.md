**Special Skills**
**Diffusion:** (Used in place of Strength to resist damage.) When a Filar-Nitzan is hit by an energy weapon of any kind or by some other element that may cause injury (such as open flame), the character rolls his diffusionskill when calculating damage. The diffusionskill requires six times the normal Character Point to increase; specializations cost three times the normal cost. Example: to improve diffusionfrom 2D to 2D+1 would require 12 Character Points instead of two; to improve diffusion: blasterfrom 2D to 2D+1 would require six Character Points instead of one. **Specializations:** Against any damage element (blaster fire, strong electricity, large quantities of other gases, open flame, etc.)

**Aversion:** (Used in place of dodge.) To avoid blaster fire and other such potentially harmful things, the Filar-Nitzan have an aversion ability, a near-equivalent to dodge. This skill allows them to change their shapes quickly enough to often avoid melee weapons and occasionally blaster fire without having to move entirely out of the way. Aversion requires double the normal Character Point cost to increase. Example: to improve aversion from 2D to 2D+1 would take four Character Points instead of two; to improve aversion: blaster from 2D to 2D+1 would take two Character Points instead of only one. **Specializations:** against nearly any weapon (melee, lightsaber, blaster, firearms,etc.) at the gamemaster’s discretion.

**Special Abilities**
**Gaseous:** As non-solid beings, the Filar-Nitzan posses many of the qualities of normal gasses: they can enter normally secure areas, and are nearly impervious to “normal” forms of attack. Because of their nature, the Filar-Nitzan receive a +2D bonus to sneak rolls. The primary disadvantage is that they have considerable difficulty generating enough mass in a given portion of their body to grasp any physical object. All manipulations of physical objects (blaster, grenade, etc.) suffer a +15 difficulty modifier.

**Story Factors**
**Reputation:** Filar-Nitzan are a nearly unknown species, considered to be a myth even more so than the Defel “wraiths.” Often referred to as “cloud demons” or “gas devils,” the Filar-Nitzan are a frightening species when encountered.

**Gamemaster Notes:**
**It is strongly recommended that players not be allowed to play Filar-Nitzan characters.**
