**Background**
The Auzituck anti-slaver gunship, also called the Auzituck-class gunship or the Wookiee gunship, was manufactured by Appazanna Engineering Works and used by Wookiees to battle slavers.

Auzituck roughly translated to “liberated one” in Shyriiwook, the native language of the Wookiees. The gunship was fast, well-armored, and heavily armed with a narrow profile and large engines. It had a dual-tiered, bubble-shaped canopy that housed the pilot in the upper rear section with the copilot and gunner in the lower forward position. The interiors were made from wroshyr trees, with sap serving as glue.

During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, one such vessel, serving as a freedom fighter against the Galactic Empire, was contracted to meet with the Ghost crew by Cikatro Vizago. But by the time it arrived, it had been raided by Trandoshan enslavers and left adrift, and the crew had been sold to the Empire.

Another gunship later rendezvoused with the Ghost to recover the Wookiee crew they had rescued.

The Wookiee bounty hunter Krrsantan also owned his Auzituck gunship during the Galactic Civil War.

Wookiee gunships joined the Citizens’ Fleet during the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal.
