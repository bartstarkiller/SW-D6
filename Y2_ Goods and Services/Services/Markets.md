**Black Market**
The network of illicit trade across the galaxy, with stationary hubs in syndicate run districts, stations, or entire planets.

**Invisible Market**
Droids, slaves, and one of a kind treasures, secrets, and biologics sold here. Coordinated through brokers, multi-step drop chains, coded datachips, and black grid hyperspace jumps, mobile marketplaces converge at triple-blind locations managed by decentralized computers unknown to buyer, seller, and broker until the deal is in motion. Couriers handle the distribution and keeping of black grid coordinates, and are expected to receive healthy compensation for their role in deals. For unsavory and secretive purchases, special droid couriers may be used with high grade countermeasures, internals, and self-destruction functions- to better protect the Market, and so that the droid may be obliterated after the most discerning sales are made.
