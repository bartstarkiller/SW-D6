**Game Notes:** 
> On constant-fire mode, each “shot” fires five blasts; holding the trigger down will fire six “shots” per round. In game terms, once a shot hits in a round, all following shots at the same or immediately adjacent target (within one meter) are one difficulty level lower. With this type of firing mode, it is much easier to shoot down a row of stormtroopers or other targets.
