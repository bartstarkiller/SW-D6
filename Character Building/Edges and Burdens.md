| Quality                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Addiction (+3D)                          | The character cannot go more than one day without drinking, gambling, etc., i.e., satisfying his addiction. Failure to do so results in lowered metabolic rates, thereby reducing the character's attribute scores by 1 for each day he goes without the cause of his addiction (on the first day, an attribute of 4D would fall to 3D+1, and so on). After one week (more or less at the gamemaster's discretion), the character has defeated his addiction. If he ever partakes of the formally addic- tive activity in the future, he has a 50% (1-3 on a roll of 1D) chance of becoming addicted again. |
| Argumentative (+1D)                      | This character constantly plays the devil's advocate. She rejoices when an exploitable situation arises, arguing though she sometimes agrees with her adversary. The argument becomes a game, a strategic contest of wills Blackouts (+2D). During high pressure situations, this character has a tendency to blackout for several minutes. She has no recollection of this lost time. In game terms the character blacks out whenever she rolls a 1 on the Wild Die for 10 minutes.                                                                                                                        |
| Center of Conversation (+1D)             | This character feels the need to always be in the middle of every conversation. And why not, they always have just the right words - or so they think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Compulsive Tendencies (+3D)              | At any time, the character may decide to do or say something that she would not normally do or say under the circumstances. For example. during a con- versation with a head of state, the character might blurt out, "Your wife is much fatter than I expected."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Debt (+1D to +3D, depending on the debt) | This character either inherited this debt or borrowed a substantial amount of money. She has a time limit for repaying the loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Delusions of Grandeur (+1D)              | The best thing to ever happen to the world. That's how characters with this Disadvantage view themselves. No one can surpass their prowess - they shouldn't even bother trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Extraordinary Hearing (-2D)              | The construction of this character's sound collectors (ears, usually), has increased his ability to distinguish between similar sounds, determine the direction of the source of those sounds, and pick up whispers from a dis- tance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Extraordinary Memory (-1D)               | This character can recall long ago events or esoteric facts with ease. In game terms, she gains +1D to most Knowledge-based skill roll (gamemaster discretion is required for some exceptions to the rule). Extraordinary Sight (-2D). The shape and genetic makeup of this character's eyes enable her to see three times as far as a normal member of her species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Extremely Competitive (+1D)              | To this character everything is a competition. She always wants to race the other characters to the battle, put herself in more danger than anyone else, and slosh down the most drinks. They cannot turn down a challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Fallback Plan (+2D)                      | This character cannot function unless they have devised a backup plan for every situation they put themself into. This applies to everything from combat to relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fanatic (+3D)                            | This character holds to a philosophical ideal, the source of which may be a sect, a nation, or a person. She will always defend this ideal, even trading her life for its preservation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hallucinations (+3D)                     | At random times, this character begins having delusions. He cannot tell when something is truly occur- ring or just a figment of his imagination. The gamemaster has full control over this Disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The character may or may not have committed the crime he has been charged with, but nevertheless, the authorities have begun their search for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| A galaxy of temptation is out there: spice, stims, lumguzzle, dethstyx, and all manner of alien intimacies are just a tiny sample of the many things that can overpower the weak-willed. And you are one of those weak. Without easy access to your vice of choice, you suffer the following penalties to all dice rolls: **1pt** for a minor addiction that causes a -1 penalty, **2pts** for a serious addiction that causes a -2 penalty, or **3pts** for a severe addiction that inflicts a -1D penalty. |

| Someone has leverage over your character, and they’re not afraid to use it. They have incriminating or defamatory evidence of your past actions, or have something you hold very dear in their possession. Whoever it is that is blackmailing you, they intend to get the most out of your predicament. For **1pt** your blackmailer only calls upon you occassionally, and the demands are not too heavy; for **2pts** your blackmailer demands your services regularly; for **3pts** your they are a constant thorn in your side who asks much of you. |

| You live by a strict code that sets you at odds with the status quo. An alien philosophy, a zealous religion, or an outlawed practice such as the Jedi, a code is not easy to live by and you will likely suffer for it. Failure to uphold the code’s ideals may have severe repercussions, depending on the details of the code that should be clearly worked out with the GM. Following a code that is inconvenient but poses little threat (e.g. a vow of silence) is worth **1pt**; a code that is difficult to follow or risks harm (pacifism in a time of war, chivalry) is worth **2pts**; a code that risks death or is outlawed by the authorities (military codes where suicide is more honorable than defeat, or the Jedi Code during the persecution by the Empire) is worth **3pts**. |

| Rightly or wrongly you have been found guilty of serious criminal acts such as grevious bodily harm, murder, treason, war crimes, aiding and abetting the Jedi, or other nefarious deeds. Why you aren’t doing time behind electrobars, slaving in the spice mines of Kessel or serving out a death sentence is up to you, but you are definitely wanted by the authorities. The seriousness of the crime and the influence of the powers that seek your incarceration is reflected in how many points you invest in this burden. For a serious but non-capital offence or a conviction by a planetary authority the burden is worth **1pt**; a very serious offence against a sector-wide authority the burden is worth **2pts**; for a galaxy-wide death sentence instigated by the Empire or the Hutt Clans the burden is worth **3pts**. The authority will do what it can to bring you to justice, including the use of bounty hunters, seizure of assets, capture of family and friends, and all sort of legal nastiness.  |

| You have pissed off someone rich and powerful, someone with no interest in upholding the law, someone wealthy enough to place a hefty price on your head— and there are plenty of bounty hunting scum are ready to track you down and bring you in alive or dead.  Or perhaps you have wronged someone, and now they dedicate their life to your death, actively seeking to destroy all you hold dear. For **1pt**, those that pursue you are of roughly equal skill, power and influence to your character; for **2pts** your enemies are clearly superior and give good reason to live in fear; for **3pts** your hunters are among the best in the galaxy.

| You owe someone some money— a lot of money. The interest is a killer (10% or more per standard month), but not as much as the heavies your debtor loves sending round, especially if you fail to make a payment. Fail twice and you’ll get the repos and the bounty hunters on your tail. Your choice of how much you owe: a small debt (1pt for 50000cr) a medium debt (2pts for 100000cr) or a huge debt (3pts for 250000cr). |

| You have someone in your life who depends on you for their wellbeing— a family member, a friend or a ward that you are responsible for. Without your care and attention they would get into serious trouble, or worse. For **1pt** the dependant can just look after themselves, and would be in a precarious position without your regular aid; for **2pts**, the dependant cannot defend or care for themselves, and would struggle to survive without you; for **3pts** the dependant is completely incapable of looking after themselves and would swiftly die without your care. (Gamemasters note this burden can have a distracting impact on the game and players should choose this Burden carefully). |

| You were a slave: a mere possession of another who could force you to do their bidding. Some slave owners take care of their belongings, but most are scum who treat their slaves like dirt. How you came to be free is up to you— perhaps you are a runaway, or murdered your master, or were freed by another, or perhaps you earned your freedom with loyal service. However you reclaimed your freedom, your hatred of slavery runs very deep. You will not allow others to suffer as you once did, which is a good thing— but in a slave-tolerant society such as the Empire or Huttspace it gets you into touble. In the presence of slaves it is an **Easy** (for **1pt**), **Medium** (for **2pts**), or **Difficult** (for **3pts**) Willpower/KNO test for you to maintain your cool. If you fail you must act to try and immediately liberate the enslaved, no matter the consequences.  |

| Something happened to you, something real bad. Maybe you did something worse. Or maybe your torment is visions of a terrible doom that draws near, something horrible and unavoidable. Either way, your character is constantly haunted to the point where it interfers with their day to day functioning. Guilt, nightmares, post (or pre) traumatic stress disorder, or even the spirits of those you have wronged now plague your life. Every 24 hours of game time you must roll a D6: on a 1 (for **1pt**), 1-2 (for **2pts**) or 1-3, (for **3pts**) you are overwhelmed by what haunts you and must suffer a 1D6 penalty to all rolls until you find release (usually down the bottom of a bottle, in a drug-induced haze or through acts of violence, or something of your own choosing). |

| An over-reliance on technology coupled with a galaxy-wide program of Imperial repression has done great damage to the education of the masses. For **1pt** your reading ability is comparable to that of a child’s, able to read simple sentences but nothing technical or detailed; for **2pts** you can barely read the simplest of words but can manage with clear symbols and pictographs; and for **3pts** your illiteracy stems from insurmountable neurological disorder or injury and you cannot recognise any symbols or letters at all.   |

| Your life is dominated by an overwhelming obsession such as a quest for vengeance, a search for lost family, the destruction of a hated enemy, or the overthrow of the Empire. It is an all-consuming passion, and any time wasted on pursuits unrelated to your obsession infuriates you. Unless the activity at hand clearly furthers your obsession, you receive a penalty to all dice rolls as follows: **1pt** for a mild obsession that causes a -1 penalty, **2pts** for a major obsession that causes a -2 penality, and **3pts** for a severe obsession that causes a -1D penalty. |

| The tyrannical rule of the Emperor has caused much of the galaxy to regress, leaving whole worlds in abject poverty. Billions upon billions have lost their careers, their possessions and their lifes to the Imperial war machine, and you are among them. For **1pt** your starting credits is 5D6x50, for **2pts** your starting credits is 5D6x10, and for **3pts** you start without any gear at all. The life of the impoverished is one full of hunger and fear; the poverty you have known for so long should have a deep impact on who you are. |

| You know something that’s very very dangerous to know: the kind of thing that people will kill to find out, or kill to make sure you tell no one. Or maybe you have a secret that will end your reputation, your career or maybe even your life should others discover it, and you must go to great (and morally dubious) lengths to keep it safe. For a relatvely low-level secret, one that would destroy your career or ruin others but with little risk of actual death it costs **1pt**; for an important secret that has broad reaching implications that could see the end of your career and possibly your life it costs **2pts**; for an extremely dangerous galaxy-shaking secret that will likely end in your death it costs **3pts**. |

| Your reputation proceeds you, for better or worse, and you are known for a particular trait or event from your past. You can use this fame (or infamy!) to your advantage, though sometimes fame has its downsides as well. A low level of fame, or being quite famous but only in a small region costs **1pt** and grants +1 to skill checks in certain social situations. A medium level of fame, or being very famous but only in one or two sectors costs **2pts** and grants +2 to skill checks in certain social situatons. A high level of fame, with a reputation known across the galaxy, costs **3pts** and grants +1D to skill checks in certain social situations. Be warned— there is a high price to fame, and if it is abused your actions will no doubt come back to haunt you. |

For **1pt** you can call in that favor from a relatively low powered individual; for **2pts** you’re owed a favor by someone with considerable influence; for **3pts** the person who owes you one is someone of great standing and galactic reach. What the favor is, and how compliant they are to your request is entirely dependant on who the person is and what you are asking of them. If the favor is agreeable to them the will do everything they can to fulfill their debt; if it is morally repugnant to them, they may drag their feet, flatly refuse, or try and wriggle out of the deal by nefarious means. |

| Whether by inheritance, hard work or illgotten gain, you have come in to a considerable sum of cold hard credits and can spend it as you like. For **1pt** you gain an additional 2500cr, for **2pts** you gain 5000cr, and for **3pts** you gain 10000cr. |

| You have always considered yourself to be extraordinarily lucky. Fortune smiles upon you just when you need it, getting you out of scrapes and jams, and providence is your friend. For **1pt**, each session you may reroll a single skill check and take the higher result; for **2pts** you may reroll two times per session, and for **3pts** you can reroll three times. |

| There’s no place quite like home, and you have gone to great lengths to make yours special. Your sanctuary could be almost anything: a family farmstead on a backwater world, or an apartment on Coruscant; a hidden laboratory where you conduct your research or a secret retreat where you train in peace, or even your starship. What ever it is, you are in your element here. For **1pt** you have a small sanctuary, fairly spartan but enough to provide you with all your needs and grant you +1 to all skill checks while you are here; for **2pts** you have a reasonably sized sanctuary, well appointed and sturdy, which grants you +2 to all skill checks while you are here; for **3pts** you have a large and well defended sanctuary with all the features you require for your purposes, which grants you +1D to all skill checks while you are here.  |

| You travel the galaxy with a faithful companion by your side, one who is unquestionably loyal and always has your back. A friend of such caliber is a rare find in these dark times, and come in all shapes and sizes: a lifelong partner, a friend since childhood, an alien who owes you a lifedebt, even a droid. A sidekick big on heart but small on ability (using a stock NPC character for stats) costs **1pt**; a sidekick who is actually useful from time to time (stock NPC but with +7D to skills) costs **2pts**; a sidekick considered your equal in prowess (essentially an extra player character) costs **3pts**. The sidekick is controlled by the GM but will do almost anything the character requests. Characters who abuse their sidekicks will swiftly find themselves all alone; characters who value and treasure their sidekick will have a friend for life. |

| She may not look like much but she’s got it where it counts— you have a starship! Actually it really is a piece of junk, a second hand light freighter in constant need of love, repairs and prayer, but hey, you can go anywhere in this thing. At least til it falls apart. **A starship costs 3pts and has a value of 50000cr. Players are allowed to pool their Starship value to buy bigger or better vessels, but each extra player who contributes only adds +25000cr to the total value of the vessel (and it still costs 3pts for each player). So:**<br><br>> **1 Player** can purchase: 50000cr of ship: 2nd-hand shuttle, 2nd-hand scoutship, or a 2nd-hand light freighter.<br><br>> **2 Players** can purchase: 75000cr of ship: New shuttle, new scoutship, or a 2nd-hand medium freighter or 2nd-hand staryacht.<br><br>> **3 Players** can purchase: 100000cr of ship: New light freighter<br><br>> **4 Players** can purchase: 125000cr or ship: 2nd-hand heavy freighter or a 2nd-hand starfighter, or a superior shuttle or scout ship.<br><br>It is recommended that GMs limit starting players to **one freighter** for ease of gameplay, but an armada is an awesome thing to aim for. |

| The Force is an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together— and when you are calm, at peace, you can feel it. In better times you may have even been considered for training as a Jedi. Maybe, a long time ago, you even were one— but you’ve turned your back on that now. For **1pt** you can sense the flow of the Force all around you and are considered Force Sensitive. For **2pts** your connection to the Force is growing, and you have one Force Power that you can use. For **3pts**, the Force is strong with this one: you gain a new Attribute: The Force, with a Force Strength Dice Code starting with 1D, and three Force Powers. All those with a connection to the Force gain the following abilities, regardless of their level of ability or training: |
> **FORCE SENSE:** Characters strong with the Force can use their Search skill to sense the flow of the Force around them. They can sense the presence of beings, artefacts and locations that are strong with the Force and if they are a source of the Light or the Dark. Sometimes the presence of the Force is so strong and overwhelming that no Search check is needed.

> **FORCE RESONANCE:** Characters strong with the Force can use their Command skill to share their emotions with those who are important to them, communicating with them no matter where they are in the galaxy. The level of clarity — from vague need, strong emotion to articulate thought — depends on the relationship between the two, the distance between them, and their training. Those with Force ability can also use their Search skill to sense when those important to them are experiencing powerful emotions: intense love, fear or anger. These flashes of insight may appear as feelings, echoes in the Force, or sudden visions. Sometimes locations with a history of great and terrible deeds, or artefacts with a strong connection to those who use the Force can resonate as well.**

| **Wounded  **                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| You suffer from a debilitating injury, war wound, or chronic illness and have a permanent penalty to two attributes (usually Dex and Str, sometimes Per or Kno for head injuries). All rolls using these attributes are at -1 (**1pt** minor injury or illness), -2 (**2pt** major injury or illness), or -1D (**3pt** crippling injury or illness). Cybernetics and bionics might be useful.** |
