**Game Notes:** 
> An astrogation buffer can store one set of nav coordinates indefinitely; note that any attempts to load more than one set of coordinates into the buffer will fail, the newest data overwriting the older information. A scomp-link (and a **Moderate** computer programming/repair roll) allows this data to be downloaded into a nav computer, after which the information is deleted.
