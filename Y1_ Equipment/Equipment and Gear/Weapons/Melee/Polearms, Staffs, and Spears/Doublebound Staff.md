> By making the Moderate difficulty roll for both attacks, a character wielding this weapon may make 2 attacks without suffering the multiple action penalty. He must declare whether or not he intends to deal physical or stun damage for each attack before they are made. Rolling **more than 10 below the Moderate difficulty** results in the character being **stunned for 1 round**. This weapon may be used to deflect blaster bolts, as described in the lightsaber combat ability, with all difficulties increased one level.
