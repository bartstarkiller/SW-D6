**Special Abilities**
**Radio Wave Generation:** The Columi are capable of generating radio frequencies with their minds, allowing them to silently communicate with their droids and automated machinery, provided that the Columi has a clear sight line to its target.

**Story Factors**
**Droid Use:** Almost every Columi encountered will have a retinue of simple droids it can use to perform tasks for it. Often, the only way these droids will function is by direct mental order (meaning only the Columi can activate them).
