> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Prehensile Tentacles:** Permians have a pair of tentacles that sprout from their sides like another set of arms. While they can be used to grab hold of things and push buttons, they are more sluggish to respond than a Permian’s regular arms. As a result, a Permian gains an additional action per round while using their tentacles without suffering a multiple action penalty. A Permian’s tentacles cannot fire a blaster, wield a weapon, or type on a datapad, but they may be used to hold an object, open a door, or another similar action.
> 
> > **Venom:** A successful bite attack against an opponent infuses a debilitating poison into their system. A character struck by Permian poison suffers a -1D penalty to Dexterity, and a -2D penalty to all Dexterity and Strength related skills. The venom lasts for 2D rounds, but the effects can be negated by using the detoxify poison Force Power, or by making a Difficult Strength check when the venom is first injected.

> **Story Factors**
> > **Displaced:** Permians have had their home planet taken from them by the Old Republic, and as a result they harbor suspicion towards all humans.

#Permian #Permis

The Permian species is one rarely seen in the galaxy after the last days of the Old Republic, joining the Caamasi and the Falleen as being aliens almost always unrecognized by the masses. While not reaching the near-mythical status of the Fosh, Permians are nontheless an odd sight in most sectors of the galaxy, especially in the human-heavy Core Worlds. It is especially rare to find a group of Permians larger than one or two together in any one place, after having most of their civilization destroyed by the brash actions of certain members of the Old Republic. Those Permians still roaming the spacelanes have not forgotten the tragic loss of their home planet, though, and any offspring that have been born since that time have had the stories of their planet’s loss passed down to them by their parents.

**Personality:** Permians are a usually cool and collected species, though a strong undertone of bitterness has infused their personalities since the loss of their world. Understandably, most Permians live secluded or isolated lives, and very few willingly engage in contact with humans. While normally calm and rational, a Permian’s anger is like a hot razor, sharp and cutting deep and fast. Overall, though, most Permians have a very calm outlook on life, moving along with their lives and rarely seeming even irritated, much less displaying outbursts of emotion. Permians are very protective of others of their species, and though some fear to gather in large groups, most will go out of their way to ensure that the few of them that are left in the galaxy remain unharmed.

**Physical Description:** Permians are a large, lizard-like race that boasts a unique pair of tentacles that protrude from their sides. Mostly humanoid in shape, Permians have rough, amphibious skin that feels slightly moist to the touch. Additionally, there is a large fleshy crest that starts at the center of their foreheads and extends over the tops of their heads to the base of their necks, standing out taller at the crown of their heads. Permians usually have gray- green fleshtones, though certain races are darker or lighter, and range from a coral blue in color to a forest green, with mottled grays over their skin. Permians also have a pair of snakelike fangs that can inject venom into an enemy with a successful bite. While not as angular as Falleen or as blunt- faced as Trandoshans, they appear to be similar to a lizard standing on its hind legs
