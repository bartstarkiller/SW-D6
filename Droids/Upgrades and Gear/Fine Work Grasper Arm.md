**Game Notes:**
> Fine work grasper arms are retractable, folding into a small compartment in the droid’s chassis. The arm extends up to 0.5 meters and has servo-boosted mechanisms in the joints and “fingers” (which allow the droid to type or manipulate small objects). There are a number of types available, some tipped with claws or pincers, others with three- or five-fingered “hands.”
