**Story Factors**
**Developing:** Because they are a developing species, beginning Lahsbee/Huhk characters may not place any skill dice in any vehicle operations, starship operations, or repair skills.
**Transformation:** Huhks are Lahsbees who are fully mature. This change comes about at puberty, but can also manifest under extreme stress or strong physical sensations of pleasure or pain. A Lahsbee character who has transformed into a Huhk must subtract 1D from his Dexterity score, and add 1D to his Strength score. Additionally, the characterâ€™s Move score is increased by 4 points.
