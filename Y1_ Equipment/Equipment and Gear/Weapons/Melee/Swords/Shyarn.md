> **Game Notes:** 
> When one shyarn strikes another, the vibrations and contact can create a powerful temporary magnetism that links the blades. When either combatant misses an attack roll by **4 or less**, the two shyarn become magnetically joined. Disengaging the blades is a full-round action, and holding the linked blade counts as an action.
