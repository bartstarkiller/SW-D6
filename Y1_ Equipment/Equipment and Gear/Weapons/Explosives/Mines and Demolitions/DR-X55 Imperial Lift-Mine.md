> **Game Notes:** 
> Mines can be set for a specific height or to move between two heights. Mines move up to 250 meters per round, although soldiers can program them to rise and fall at slower speeds. Mines detect vehicles up to 100 meters away. Once a target is detected, it will adjust its height to match that of the vehicle. Detonates when a vehicle passes within 3 meters. Gamemaster should make map of mine field. When entering a mine field, the pilot must make a piloting roll for every mine within 20 meters of his flight path (reflecting the adjustments and minute course alterations he will make during the round). Any mine that beats his roll explodes. Mines cannot be detonated by other mines. Mine fields often force pilots to make multiple maneuver rolls each round.
