## Overview

**Zexx** were massive, long-lived humanoids indigenous to Prazhi in the Expansion Region who bore a strong resemblance to Esoomians. They were covered in gray scales with pointed heads that boasted long, curved tusks. Zexx were violent and possessive, often found acting as pirates or mercenaries for Hutt crime lords. Individuals of the race included Fnnbu.

The Zexx tusks were strong and sharp enough to cut through living tissue. Their culture attached much importance to concepts of ownership and property, and they reacted violently to "borrowing" objects without permission.
