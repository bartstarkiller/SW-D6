**Game Notes:** 
An **Easy** sensor roll required for normal operation. Device can operate in two modes. In passive mode it produces a 360-degree field out to 5 meters. Sounds emitted outside this radius are “absorbed” – only sounds emitted from within the bubble are heard within the bubble. In activate mode, a 60-degree arc can be generated out to 10 meters. Within this arc, sound waves are effectively dampened, preventing any aural vibration from being sensed by live or automated detectors.
