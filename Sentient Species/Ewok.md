**Special Skills**
**Dexterity Skills:**
**Thrown weapons:** bows, rocks, sling, spear. Time to use: one round. The character may take the base skill and/or any of the specializations.

**Mechanical Skils:**
**Glider:** Time to use: one round. The ability to pilot gliders.

**Technical Skills:**
**Primitive Construction:** Time to use: one hour for gliders and rope bridges; several hours for small structures, catapults and similar constructs. This is the ability to build structures out of wood, vines and other natural materials with only tools. This skill is good for building sturdy houses, vine bridges and rock hurling catapults (2D speeder-scale damage).

**Special Abilities** Skill Bonus: At the time the character is created only, the character gets 2D for every 1D placed in the hide, search and sneak skills.

**Skill Limits:** Beginning characters may not place any skill dice in any vehicle (other than glider) or starship operations or repair skills.

**Smell:** Ewoks have a highly developed sense of smell, getting a +1D bonus to their search skill when tracking by scent.

**Story Factors**
**Protectiveness:** Most human adults will feel unusually protective of Ewoks, wanting to protect them like young children. Because of this, Humans can also be very condescending to Ewoks. Ewoks, however, are mature and inquisitive - and unusually tolerant of the Human attitude.
