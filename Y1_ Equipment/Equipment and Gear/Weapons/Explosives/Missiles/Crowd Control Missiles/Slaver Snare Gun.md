> **Game Notes:** 
> Upon initial contact, the target individual must make an opposed **Strength** roll to avoid entanglement; the snare has a beginning **Strength** of **3D**. Failure to do so results in entanglement. The snare’s Strength increases by **+1D** for each additional round as the filaments continue to constrict and harden. The filaments cause no physical damage. A special formulated dissolving agent degrades the filaments.
