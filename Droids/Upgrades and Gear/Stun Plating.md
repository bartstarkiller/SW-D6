**Game Notes:** 
> A stun field is built into a droidâ€™s exterior to deliver a painful shock to any creatures touching the droid. Anyone touching the droid (including melee weapon attacks) when the field is active takes 4D stun damage. A stun field emits a constant humming noise while active, granting a +2 bonus to search rolls to notice the droid.
