**Game Notes:** 
> Upon activation, the intended victim must make a Moderate brawling parry roll to avoid entrapment (for victims up to 150 kilograms; victims from 151-300 kilograms need only make an **Easy** roll, while 301-450 kilograms targets require a **Very Easy** roll; this unit has no effect on targets over 450 kilograms). Failure results in an immediate -1D to Dexterity and 1D stun damage. Increase the brawling parry difficulty to escape by one level each additional round and increase the Dexterity penalty by -1D and increase the stun damage by +1D. The target is fully cocooned when the Dexterity penalty matches or exceeds the character’s Dexterity or the stun damage is sufficient to knock out the character.
