> Game Notes: 
> Useable either as a ranged or melee weapon. When used as a ranged weapon, the disks launched from the lanvarok spread out, increasing the chances of a hit. This grants a **1D bonus to hit any target within 10 meters**. Anyone using a lanvarok who also possesses the Telekinesis Force power can extend this bonus to the full range of the weapon with a successful use of that power. A lanvarok takes a full round to load.
