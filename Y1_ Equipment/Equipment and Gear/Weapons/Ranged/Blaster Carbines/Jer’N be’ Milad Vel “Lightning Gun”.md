> **Game Notes:** 
> This is not a normal “blaster”, firing “packets” of charged sub-atomic particles. The lightning gun blast resembles an elongated blaster bolt, except that it is a distinctive actinic blue-white color, and it makes a ripping crack sound, similar to thunder. Lightning guns cannot be set on stun.
