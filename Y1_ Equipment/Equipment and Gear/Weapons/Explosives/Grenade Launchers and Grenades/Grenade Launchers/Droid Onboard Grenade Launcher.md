**Game Notes:** 
> The droid grenade launcher cannot be equipped on droids smaller than 1 meter; targeting circuitry and the size of the weapon make such installation impossible. The basic version of the weapon can be detected with a **Moderate** sensors roll or a **Difficult** search or Perception roll. The sensor-resistant version requires a **Difficult** sensors roll or a **Very Difficult** search or Perception roll to detect.
