## Overview

**Vultans** were a Near-Human species native to the planet Vulta. 
Oss Wilum was a famous Vultan who was also a Jedi during the Naddist Uprising.

## Biology and Appearance

Vulta were physically similar to Humans except for their pale olive skin, and a mass of fleshy cartilage folds, ridges, and strands covering the top and back of their heads. These ridges were said to be able to protect the head of the Vultan against most forms of injury. Male Vultans tended to have folds and ridges on their heads, while females tended to have fleshy strands radiating out from the head. This visible difference was said to have an impact on the Vultans' mating and courtship rituals. . Other features include: two toed feet, ridged structures on the upper torso, fin-like growths on the back, and, sometimes, white eyes, lacking pupils and irises. 


## Society and Culture

As a people, the Vultans were enamored with the latest in trends and fashions, and were known for their skill with technology

## History

During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the Vultan Echari Di'San became leader of the Cularin Trade Alliance, a trade organization that operated in the Cularin system.
