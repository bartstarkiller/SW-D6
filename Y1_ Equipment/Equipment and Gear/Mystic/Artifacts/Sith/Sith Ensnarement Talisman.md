**Game Notes:**
> Force-user must touch the talisman throughout the Force powerâ€™s initiation. It grants a 1D, 2D, or 3D bonus to any one Force skill. Affected skill may be changed between uses of Force powers, but not during the initiation of one power that requires more than one Force skill. The amount of bonus is dependant on the particular taliman; weaker ones are more common, while the more powerful ones are extremely rare.
>  Each time a light sider uses the device he must make a willpower or control roll against an ever-increasing difficulty. The first use requires a **Very Easy** roll, the second an **Easy** roll, the third a **Moderate** roll, and so forth. Failing the roll means that the user automatically turns to the dark side.
