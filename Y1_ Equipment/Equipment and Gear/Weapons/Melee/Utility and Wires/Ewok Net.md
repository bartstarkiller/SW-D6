> **Game Notes:** 
> Any character successfully entangled by an Ewok net suffers a –2D penalty to all actions, including initiative rolls. Untangling oneself from an Ewok net can be accomplished in one of two ways: either the entangled character must succeed at a Moderate Dexterity check and take 1D turns to free himself (failure indicates he may try again, but at one difficulty level lower), or he must make an opposed Strength check against the net’s Strength score.
