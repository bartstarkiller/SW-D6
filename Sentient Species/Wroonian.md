Wroonian society was wealthy, fun-loving, and deeply spiritual; as a result, Wroonians often wore ornate clothing and tattoos. Wroonians loved travel both at sea and in space. A well-traveled species, they were represented in the Galactic Republic by the Pantoran Senator Chi Eekway Papanoida and later were part of the Galactic Empire. There were numerous Wroonian colonies, such as on Saleucami.

Wroonians were renowned for telling boastful stories.
