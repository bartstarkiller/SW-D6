Background: The J-19 Bo-rifle was manufactured by the Lasan-Malamut Firearms Corporation. It was black in color, with a bayonet along the top edge and a folding stock along the back. It was considered less artfully designed than the older AB-75 model.

Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau used a J-19 in battle, which he modified for close-quarters fighting. He initially claimed to have taken it from a Lasan High Honor Guard during the Siege of Lasan. This claim earned him the enmity of Garazeb Orrelios, who believed he was thus using it without a right. However, Kallus later revealed that the guardsman had gifted it to him upon being defeated by the Boosahn Keeraw, the Lasat warrior way.
