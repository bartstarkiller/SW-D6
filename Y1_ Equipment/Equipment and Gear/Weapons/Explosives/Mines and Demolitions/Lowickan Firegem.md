> Game Notes: Lowickan firegems, when exposed to high- levels of the type of radiation found in starship reactor cores, detonate in a massive explosion (3D minutes of exposure is normally necessary for detonation). A firegem causes 1D of radiation damage after the first hour, increasing the damage by +1D for each additional hour of exposure unless handlers are wearing proper radiation gear.
