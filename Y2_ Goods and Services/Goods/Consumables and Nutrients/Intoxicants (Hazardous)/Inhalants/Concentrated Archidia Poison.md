> **Game Notes:** 
> If this concentrated archidia poison is inhaled, the inhaler must make a **Very Difficult** Strength check to avoid its effects. If this roll is failed, the user loses <u>6D+2</u> pips from his Perception score for 1D days. This loss is temporary, but if it reduces the characterâ€™s Perception below 0D, he <u>enters a coma</u> and can only be revived with the proper medical attention.
