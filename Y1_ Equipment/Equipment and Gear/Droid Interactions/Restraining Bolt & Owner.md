**Game Notes:**
> Retraining bolts have a die code of 3D. Whenever the Droid is commanded to do something, roll 3D against the Droid’s Perception. If the bolt rolls higher, the droid obeys the bolt. If the Droid rolls higher, the Droid can ignore the retraining bolt.
“Halt” lasts 10 seconds.
“Return” compels the Droid to return.
“Orders” gives pleasure to the Droid so that it will obey its master. If the roll is successful, the Droid will obey the owner regardless of the length of time involved.
