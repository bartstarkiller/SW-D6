> **Game Notes:** 
> Razorbugs are used as thrown weapons by the Yuuzahn Vong, and guide themselves towards their targets. If they miss, they will return to the thrower at the end of the following round. The razorbug guides itself to the target, granting a **+1 pip bonus to the throwerâ€™s skill roll.** If the razorbug hits its target, it uses its claws to burrow deeper into the wound on the following round (doing another 3D+1 of damage) unless it is removed first.
