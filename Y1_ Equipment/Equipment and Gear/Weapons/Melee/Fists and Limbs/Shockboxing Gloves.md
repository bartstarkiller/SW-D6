**Game Notes:** 
Shockboxing gloves can be set to three power settings: Low, Medium, and High. Each setting higher than “Low” adds an additional +1D of stun damage, to a maximum of STR+3D (for the “High” setting). After-market modifications and jury-rigs can transform standard gloves into lethal weapons. Such models cost up to 1500 credits per pair, and the damage is considered to be lethal.
