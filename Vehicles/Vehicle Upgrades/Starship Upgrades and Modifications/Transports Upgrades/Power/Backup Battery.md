**Game Notes:**
> This backup battery is marketed as a life support system fail-safe, allowing up to an hourâ€™s extra survival in the event of a catastrophic power failure. Ordinarily, life support fails while running silent in only a few minutes, due to lack of power, but the backup battery allows the ship to lurk in space for an extended period.
