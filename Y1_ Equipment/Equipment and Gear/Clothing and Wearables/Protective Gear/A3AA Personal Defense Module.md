> Game Notes: 
> Generally available only to Imperial hunters. Micro-nozzle spray system generates a five meter diameter cloud that disperses charged energy beams. The cloud reduces the damage of all blaster bolts by -2D. Dependant on prevailing wind conditions, once triggered, the dissipation field remains in effect upwards of four minutes. Optional adjustment generates a continuous 30 degree forward- facing cone of dispersal, for rapid forward movement.
