Henry Bernbeg has made an interactive Galaxy Map on CARTO using his Spatial Analytics specialty- incredibly impactful and designer- HOWEVER it only links to Wookiepedia rather than any ability for links to my obsidian platforms.

Possibilities:
? Buy option to have a custom and useable map?
? Purchase CARTO for myself (probabbly crazy difficult to do accurately + hosting fees)
Integrate as map server to Obsdian Leaflet ?(will internet connection be required to work?)
Pirate coords and hyperlane images (can I make a hollow icon at appropriate scale to allow me to link to routes and sectors without sending to planetary notes?)

Depict Firefist and other Satellite Galaxies as a seperate map or layer? extend map to include Firefist beyond galactic edge?

Contingencies:
Map loses functionality or goes down: Keep planets at position on Obsidian notes, but load a static image at equivalent scale and resolution so planets remain at same place. I think a similar move could be used to 'pirate' Henry's well-done map, but I think it's immoral and cannot be done without permission or / and financial compensation. Using such a tactic for my offline use should be OK, but I could never actually release a product with integrated map included if I did. 
Moderate benefit would be potential of making background image a holo-photoshopped or holo-.gif, which if I had holo-image icons for planets would be a deliciously flavored retexture.
