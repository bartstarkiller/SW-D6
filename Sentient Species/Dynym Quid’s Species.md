A sentient species of cephalopod-like humanoids lived in the galaxy. During the Great Jedi Purge, one member of this species was among the refugees on Jabiim who were given passage to Tessen aboard Kawlan Roken’s Jabiim freight transport. Another member was Dynym Quid, who spent time in the Canto Casino in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica in 34 ABY.
