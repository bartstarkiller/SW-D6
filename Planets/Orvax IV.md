"_For a slave, Orvax is the living hell of the galaxy. There is no worse place that I know of._"

â€•Mezgraf

**Orvax IV** was a slave trade planet in the Outer Rim Territories. Slaves were stored in dungeons here before being sold off to slave owners. The slave traders lived in the upper levels of the cities. Members of the [[T'surr]] species worked as security staff.

Following the Battle of Half-Axe Pass, the Empire deported captured Nosaurian women and children there. Darth Vader, upon discovering this in a debriefing with the 501st Legion, grew despondent of the news due to his former status as a slave on Tatooine. Dass Jennir and the crew of the _Uhumele_ attempted to rescue Bomo Greenbark's family, only to find that his wife Mesa had been killed and his daughter Resa sold to [[Dezono Qua]] on [[Esseles]] (thus sealing her fate, as Qua regularly bought a child slave to eat).
