> [!_1] Magnetic Wingplates
> > Some captains have modified the “wings” on either side of the cruiser with magnetic plates. Typically this is so a ship can carry more cargo and make more money, but it is also a favorite tactic used by smugglers who can quickly dump the cargo and try to escape. Four plates can be placed on either wing, taking up 5 tons and costing 2,000 credits each. Each can hold one [[Class Four Cargo Container]], giving an additional 10 metric tons of cargo space.

**Background**
The C-ROC Gozanti-class light cruiser, also known as the C-ROC Carrier Ship, with the shipyard custom configuration known as the Configuration-Restored Operational Capacity, was an official modified version of the Gozanti-class cruiser that was manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation prominently during the Clone Wars and the Imperial Era.

The C-ROC Gozanti-class light cruiser, also referred to as the C-ROC carrier ship, was a class of light cruiser that was equipped with the Configuration-Restored Operational Capacity upgrade, a shipyard custom configuration of the standard civilian Gozanti-class cruiser, which was manufactured by Corellian Engineering Corporation and meant to be a midlife upgrade program to reinvigorate the Gozanti-class and create more profitability.

The C-ROC was designed to be bulkier than the original Gozanti class and had many cosmetic and mechanical modifications, which diverged it from the standard cruiser. The C-ROC’s hull design was considered softer and more rounded, in contrast to the bold and square-shouldered lines of the standard cruiser. The front two-thirds of the C-ROC’s hull had a sloping, bell-shaped cross-section that was narrow on the dorsal side while flaring below the midship line. Although the C-ROC was not as large as a true cruiser, its tight corridors and compartments could make for intense close-quarters combat and had consumables capacity for two months.

The design of the new hull provided more protection as the slope of the hull deflected blasts more efficiently than the original Gozanti-class. Outrigger cargo trays designed to carry modular cargo containers similar to the GR-75 medium transport replaced the two cranked delta wings. In concert with the complete redesign of the ship’s interior, the outriggers provided the C-ROC with exceptional hauling capability at the cost of the ship’s combat and fleet support utility. The outrigger racks, extended prow, and the bridge module softened the original cruiser’s sharp design edges.

Although surpassing or meeting the original Gozanti-class cruiser in most metrics, the C-ROC was deprived of military-grade sensors and ordnance launchers. However, it was equipped with a medium-range sensor. With the original cruiser kept slow to appease Galactic Republic inspectors concerned the ship could be used for piracy, the C-ROC was equipped with three additional sublight engine turbines that brought its top speed back in line with other starships of the same category. The two original Girodyne Ter58 ion engines were replaced with five Novaldex JV-80 ion drives that were newer and faster. Two each were placed on port and starboard, while another was mounted on the dorsal spar. The C-ROC could be crewed by a single pilot but had a typical crew of twelve. The crew included one pilot and co-pilot, one engineer, one communications and sensor operator, two loadmasters, and six gunners.

Despite the C-ROC’s armor and deflector shields remaining untouched from the original design, the weapons loadout was drastically reduced to two retractable quad laser cannon turrets—one ventral and one dorsal—which provided good defense against smaller ships, such as patrol boats and starfighters. Each of the C-ROC’s broad flanks was equipped with two retractable twin heavy laser cannons that kept pirates at bay. Although it did not carry the original firepower of the original design, the C-ROC was capable of defending itself from most foreseeable threats. Many owners routinely relied on the C-ROC’s speed rather than firepower to escape danger. The C-ROC could be modified to carry four M3-A Scyk interceptors in its ventral hull.
