**Background**
The LAAT/le patrol gunship, also known as patrol transport, police gunship, known first as the Republic police gunship and later as the Imperial patrol transport, was a gunship introduced during the Clone Wars to perform law enforcement functions on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Designed to be sleeker and smaller as well as less heavily armed than the Republic attack gunship, the patrol transport was better suited for policing the dense, planet-wide city while reducing the risks of collateral damage.

After the formation of the Galactic Empire, the patrol transport saw a broader use as a patrol craft for the Imperial Military on various worlds, as well as an escort carried on some of its capital ships. Patrol transports saw extensive use against various rebel cells and factions during both the early Rebellion and the Galactic Civil War.
