## Overview

Kessurians were a sentient species. They had elongated ears and montrals, which increased their senses. Wilsa Teshlo was a Kessurian thilas, second in line to the throne, but refused to be trapped in the life of royalty, and fled to join the Veiled Sorority pirate gang. A dance troupe attended the Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors in 35 ABY.
