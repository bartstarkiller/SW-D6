**Game Notes:** 
A medkit functions as a medpac that can be used up to 10 times. The diagnostic instruments in the kit can also be used to diagnose diseases afflicting a patient, to assess health, and for other basic medical uses on an **Easy** first aid roll. The kit also allows a character with the medicine advanced skill to perform field surgery (which exhausts the kit’s medpacs)

%% You're paying 200 credits for a BOX? It literally costs as much as 10 medkits. Compact supplies are good, but I don't see the added value beyond space saving (which surely could be achieved with normal Medkits, or by creating space diagram puzzles on canvas to orient supplies for optimal storage.) 

**I think field surgery is unfair to use as it 'exhuasts' all the medpacs, but just uses however many charges are left. A more complicated but fairer solution would be lowering difficulty of (what should be difficult without tools) field surgery rolls** *by a set amount for each medpack charge used*, therefore benefitting the doctor while allowing for strategy, risk, and conservation of resources.%%
