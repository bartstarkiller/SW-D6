**Special Abilities**
**Technological Ignorance:** The Karrans know almost nothing about technology and have a difficult time grasping new concepts. They suffer a -1D penalty whenever they attempt to use any item more advanced than simple stone age-era tools.
**Claws:** The Karrans can use their foreclaws as weapons doing STR damage.

**Story Factors**
**Altruism:** A Karrenâ€™s sense of individuality is easily suppressed by it insectoid sense of community survival. The group, whether it be village, tribe or species, is of much greater importance than the individual. As a result, it is not uncommon for a Karren to sacrifice itself, if this sacrifice represents a potential for the group to survive.
