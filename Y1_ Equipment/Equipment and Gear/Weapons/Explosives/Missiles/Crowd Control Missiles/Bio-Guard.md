> **Game Notes:** 
> Bio-Guard is a cylindrical tube measuring 12 centimeters in length by 2 centimeters in diameter. It is operated by firm pressure on a control stud; once fired, it must be replaced. When activated, emitter sprays a concentrated stream of four different chemical components, each in rapid succession. As alien biologies differ dramatically, the effects of the device’s individual agents may not always prove effective with every species.
