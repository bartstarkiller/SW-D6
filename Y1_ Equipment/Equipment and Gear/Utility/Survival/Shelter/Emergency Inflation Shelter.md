**Game Notes:** 
> Prior to activation, the PSC is a flat, 1 meter square, 25 centimeters thick cube that houses an inflatable, highly reflective fabric shelter. Filaments running throughout the fabric draw solar energy to the shelter’s batteries, allowing for up to 10 hours of continuous use. When fully inflated, the shelter expands to a diameter of 2.5 meters and oxygen recycling and heating elements are automatically activated. A zippered entranceway gives access to the interior. A Very Easy survival roll is required for activation.
