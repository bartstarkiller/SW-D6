**Special Abilities**
**Delicate Build:** Due to the jiivaharâ€™s fragile bone structure they suffer a -2 modifier to all Strength rolls to resist damage.

**Produce Sarvin:** The Jiivahar can secrete an adhesive substance, sarvin, from the pores in their hands and feet. This substance gives them a +1D bonus to the climbing skill. In addition, it also gives them a +1D bonus to any Strength rolls for the purposes of clutching objects or living creatures. The Jiivahar cleanse themselves of the sarvin through controlled perspiration; it takes one round to do this.

**Story Factors**
**Curiosity:** Jiivahar have an inherent curiosity of the world around them. They will actively seek out any new experiences and adventures.
