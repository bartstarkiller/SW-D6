**Game Notes:**
> These cargo containers have a low-powered repulsorlift coil matrix and power supply cleverly concealed in the bottom casing. A small compensator c-board helps the repulsorfield neutralize the weight of anything inside, making the box feel like it’s empty. Scans detect a sleight box’s energy source on a **Difficult** sensor roll; increase the difficulty one level if the container is stowed near another power source.
