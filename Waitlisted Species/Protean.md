**Special Skills**
**Shape-Shifting (A):** Time to use: Varies, depending on the shape; generally 1-10 minutes. This is an advanced skill (A). The Protean can assume complex shapes. Simple geometric shapes, like cubes or spheres, are **Very Easy** to replicate. A basic humanoid form is **Difficult** to replicate, additional details add more modifiers to the difficulty. Proteans roll this skill when assuming the new form. They don’t have to roll to maintain the new form or to resume their normal state. 

**Special Abilities**
**Chemical and Tactile Communication:** Although they can vocalize, Proteans communicate through touch and chemical exchange. They cannot communicate to non- Proteans.

**Shape-Shifting**: A Protean can alter its shape. It cannot alter its mass. It can reform its shape to fit into a space as small as 30 centimeters wide. It can mimic most rocky materials. A shape-shifter that performs an Easy shape-shiftingcan produce a weapon from its form, with added spikes, which increase brawlingdamage by +2D. When a Protean conceals itself as a rock-like form, passers by must make successfulPerceptionor searchrolls against the Protean’s shape-shiftingto detect it. The Protean receives bonus modifiers if the searchers are unfamiliar with the nature of the Protean or the native rocks.

**Story Factors**
**Primitive:** Beginning Protean characters cannot place any dice in Mechanical or Technical skills. They are limited in their selection of Knowledge skills as well.


**Notes:**
A favorite attack of a hungry Protean is the smother attack. The Protean typically hides as a rock form, lying in wait for unwitting prey. If a potential meal comes within reach, the Protean strikes, enveloping it. To simulate this tactic, have the Protean make a successful brawlingattempt against a character’s dodge. If it succeeds, the Protean does no damage, but has trapped the prey. It then smothers the character, who must make three Difficult Strength attempts to break free. If the victim fails the three attempts, the Protean begins dealing STR damage. If the Protean is having difficulty subduing the enveloped prey, it will grow “teeth” (**Easy** shape-shiftingroll), increasing it damage by +2D. Note that the enveloped victim will eventually suffocate if he doesn’t break free. A difficult Strength or Dexterity is needed to draw any weapons. An Incapacitated total against the Protean forces it to release its victim.

This species is not recommended for player characters.
