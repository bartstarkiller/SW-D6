Game Notes:
> Kaiburr crystal stores Force points, which can be used by a Force-user that takes possession of it. Each crystal stores five Force points, and these Force points can only be used to increase rolls made to employ Force powers. As long as the crystal is in close proximity to the Temple of Pomojema on Mimban, it regains 1 Force point every minute. If removed from Mimban, a crystal does not regain spent Force points, but can be used as a lightsaber crystal. Kaiburr crystals used in this way grant a +2 pip bonus to the lightsaberâ€™s damage, as well as a +2 pip bonus to all lightsaber skill rolls.
