## Overview

The **Quockrans** were a sentient species of slugs/Legends") native to the planet Quockra-4. The species had a large, fat body that tapered to a tail. Their torso also had two arms, ending in stubby digits. The black-skinned Quockrans had no differentiated internal organs. During their evolution, their homeworld was a moist planet. Nevertheless, the climate changed, becoming dry and hot. This drove the Quockrans' society underground, apart from short forays to the surface. The Quockrans were a xenophobic species, desiring isolation from all other species. When the Minos Cluster was colonized late in the administration of the Galactic Republic, offworlders reached Quockra-4. The Quockrans responded to this violation of their isolation by manufacturing an entire society of droids to act as intermediaries with the offworlders. These droids traded with offworlders, largely keeping the existence of the Quockrans a secret.

## Biology and Appearance
The Quockrans were a sentient species of giant slugs/Legends"). Their bodies had a large, fat torso that tapered to a tail marked with large rolls of fat. Quockrans averaged between 1.4 and 1.7 meters in length, although some had the ability grow as long as two meters. The Quockrans had a significant paunch and large drooping breasts. They had two arms that ended in four stubby fingers. The slug-like creatures had black skin, with splotches and other growths running down their midline and tail, as well as down the top of their arms. They had no differentiated internal organs, which limited the injury a single wound could do to their bodies.

Quockran heads appeared knobbly. Each Quockran had a nose high on its forehead, with its eyes below this, one on each side of its heads. Below its nose was a large mouth, filled with sharp teeth. Quockran chins were large and drooping.

## Society and Culture

The Quockrans were a xenophobic species, avoiding contact with other species if at all possible. While they despised offworlders, this rarely manifested as violence toward them. They were indifferent to galactic affairs and refused to get involved in political causes such as the Rebellion. If a Quockran was forced to interact with other species, they were surly and uncooperative, preferring, simply, to be left alone.

To facilitate their isolation, the Quockrans manufactured an entire society of droids to interact with offworlders in their homeworld's sole city. Composed of thousands of different designs, both Imperial models and other, more exotic styles, and numbering over ten million individual units, the droids appeared to manage all the affairs of Quockra-4. The automata followed a clearly delineated hierarchy: three-armed yellow repair droids were superior, giving out orders in their machine language; red worker models were in the middle; Imperial droids were at the bottom, functioning as translators for those of higher rank. With this system in place, the Quockrans were able to live far below ground, only emerging on the surface at night to loll about in the cooling desert sands.

## History

The Quockrans evolved on Quockra-4, the fourth planet in the Quockra system, located in the remote Minos Cluster of the southern Outer Rim Territories. The planet was originally moist, and the Quockrans lived on the surface. The climate changed, however, becoming a homogeneous desert, with several large salt flats. The surface temperature reached polar extremes, with soaring highs during the day and frigid temperatures at night. This drove the Quockrans deep underground, although they still occasionally emerged at night to enjoy the cooler, damper air.

When the Minos Cluster was colonized, late in the administration of the Galactic Republic, the Quockrans created a droid society to interact with the newly arrived offworlders. The Quockrans used these droids as intermediaries for trading, and most inhabitants of the Minos Cluster were unaware the species existed. Any who were aware of the Quockrans' existence and who tried to interfere with their affairs quickly found themselves in trouble.
