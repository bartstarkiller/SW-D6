**Special Abilities**
**Rage:** When a Dazouri is wounded, badly frightened, threatened with bodily harm, successfully intimidated or infuriated, he transform into rage form. He can also initiate it at will, but it is a **Very Difficult Perception** task. They can also prevent rage transformation with a **Heroic** **Perception** roll.

**Dual Form:** Dazouris and [[Lahsbees]] are closely related races: “genetic cousins” in the same way Humans and near-Human races are closely related. Like the [[Lahsbees]], Dazouris physically transform from one form to another. The character must allocate dice for the rage and rest forms. Dazouris also receive a +1D bonus to **Dexterity** and **Strength** for their rage form. Dazouris retain the same skill adds, no matter their form. **Dazouris in rage form may only use brawling parry, dodge, melee combat, melee parry, intimidation, brawling, climbing/jumping and lifting.**

**Claws:** Do STR+2D damage (rage form only).
**Teeth:** Do STR+1D+2 damage (rage form only).
**Horns:** Do STR+1D damage (rage form only).
