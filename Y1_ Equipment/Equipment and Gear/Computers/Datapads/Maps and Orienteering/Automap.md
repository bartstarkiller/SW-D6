**Game Notes:** 
> It is virtually impossible for a character using an Automap to get lost. As long as the device is linked to an orbiting source of data (such as a ship’s sensors or weather satellite) the device relays accurate data regarding the user’s location, local weather conditions, other moving objections and navigational hazards. The link requires a **Moderate** computer programming/repair roll once per hour to maintain. Failure indicates that the link has been terminated and the device will extrapolate the character’s position with marginal accuracy. (Unlinked automaps produce faulty position data on anything less than a **Difficult** computer programming/repair roll.)
