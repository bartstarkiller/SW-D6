Model: Imperial Munitions Rampart II Shield Generator
Type: Portable shield generator
Scale: Character
Skill: Computer programming/repair
Crew: 1

**Game Notes:**
> Provides 6D character-scale protection to those behind the shield. These shields are currently configured to one of two settings, either closing off an entire corridor, or standing roughly 1.5 meters high, and stretching 6 meters wide, allowing ample protection while permitting return fire. When the shield is struck, roll 6D versus the damage code of the weapon fired. If this total is lower than the weapon’s damage roll, the generrator’s protection drops -1D; when the shield reaches 0D, it is destroyed.
