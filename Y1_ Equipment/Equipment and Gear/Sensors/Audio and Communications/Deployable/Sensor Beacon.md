**Game Notes:** 
> It is a pole 1.4 meters long when collapsed and 3 meters long at full extension. Sensor has a built-in comlink with a 50-km range. When activated, it continually scans the area within 250 meters of it with a search skill of 5D to notice any vehicles or creatures moving within its monitored area. It can be set to sound an alarm or send an alert by comlink, when it detects a vehicle or creature of a particular size, or anything at all. Can also be continuously monitored locally or remotely via a video-comlink, granting a +1D search bonus.
