**Running:** Eirraucs use four of their six limbs when running. They only need to make stamina checks once every hour when running at all-out speed, and get a bonus of +1D to their running skill.

**Multi-actions:** Eirraucs can use their mid-legs as a second set of arms when they’re not running; they may take a second action in a round at no penalty. Third actions incur a -1D penalty, fourth actions suffer -2D and so forth.

**Vision:** Eirraucs can see in any direction except immediately behind them (300° arc).

**Temperature Sensitivity:** In extremely cold or hot conditions, increase all Strength and Dexterity skill checks by one difficulty level.

**Tongue:** STR+1 damage.
