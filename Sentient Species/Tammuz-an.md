## Overview

The **Tammuz-an** people were a tall, gaunt [humanoid](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Humanoid/Legends "Humanoid/Legends") species native to the [planet of the same name](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tammuz-an/Legends "Tammuz-an/Legends"). They were divided into two races: the purple-skinned Tammuz-an of the Kingdom of Julpa, and the blue-skinned inhabitants of the Outer Territories.

## History

The kings of the purple Tammuz-an were the overall rulers of the planet. Though their monarchy was hereditary, the rightful king could not be crowned unless he presented the royal scepter to an official known as the [Keeper of the Tower](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Tower "Keeper of the Tower") at the first sun of the equinox. During the early [Imperial](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire/Legends "Galactic Empire/Legends") era, the rightful Crown Prince of Tammuz-an, [Mon Julpa](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Julpa "Mon Julpa"), was mind-wiped by his [vizier](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vizier/Legends "Vizier/Legends") [Ko Zatec-Cha](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ko_Zatec-Cha "Ko Zatec-Cha"), disguised as an [android](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Android/Legends "Android/Legends"), and left on the planet [Tyne's Horky](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tyne%27s_Horky "Tyne's Horky"). Zatec-Cha's intent was to take the scepter and present it to the Keeper of the Tower, thus becoming king.

After regaining his memories, thwarting Zatec-Cha's plans, and returning to the throne (thanks to the loyalist Tammuz-an [Sollag Den](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sollag_Den "Sollag Den"), the [Humans](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Human/Legends "Human/Legends") [Jann Tosh](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jann_Tosh "Jann Tosh") and [Jessica Meade](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jessica_Meade "Jessica Meade"), and the droids [R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2/Legends "R2-D2/Legends") and [C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO/Legends "C-3PO/Legends")), Mon Julpa tried to unite his planet's two feuding races by marrying Princess [Gerin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gerin_Toda "Gerin Toda"), daughter of Lord [Toda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malameu_Toda "Malameu Toda") of the Outer Territories. When the [pirate](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate/Legends "Pirate/Legends") [Gir Kybo Ren-Cha](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gir_Kybo_Ren-Cha "Gir Kybo Ren-Cha") kidnapped the princess, Toda worked with Julpa and his allies to free her. The newfound unity of the two cultures was strengthened by this struggle against a common threat, as well as by the love between the Mon Julpa and Gerin.
