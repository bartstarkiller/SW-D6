> **Game Notes:** 
> The b’hedda resembles a scooped atlatl with a meter-long wooden handle and a hooked blade on the opposite end. The hooked metal blade grants a +1D climbing bonus for Dugs with the melee combat: b’hedda specialization. The wielder can use the atlatl end to fling homemade explosive projectiles called bangcaps that detonate on impact. Non-Dugs take a -1D penalty on all attack rolls with this weapon.
