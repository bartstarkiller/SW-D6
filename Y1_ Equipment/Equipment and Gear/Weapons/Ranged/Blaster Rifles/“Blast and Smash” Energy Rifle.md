> **Game Notes:** 
> This micro-grenade launcher has a computerized fire control system. If the character can make a Moderate Perception roll (this is a free action and doesn’t count as a skill use, so there are no penalties), the character can add +1D to hit when the weapons is fired; if the character is firing at the same target repeatedly, the character automatically gets the +1D for the second and following shots. A bi-pod may be attached to the rifle, adding +1D to the blaster roll.
> 
> **Alliance-modified version:** On constant-fire mode, the rifle fires a burst of 2 blasts per shot. Once a hit is established, all following shots against nearby (1 meter) targets are one difficulty lower.
