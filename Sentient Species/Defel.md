> [!_2] 
> **Special Skills**
> **Dexterity Skills**
> > **Blind Fighting:** Time to use: one round. Defel can use this skill instead of their brawling or melee combat skills when deprived of their sight visors or otherwise rendered blind. Blind fighting teaches the Defel to use its senses of smell and hearing to overcome any blindness penalties.
> 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Invisibility:** Defel receive a +3D bonus when using the sneak skill.
> 
> **Claws:** The claws of the Defel can inflict STR+2D damage.
> > **Light Blind:** Defels eyes can only detect ultraviolet light, and the presence of any other light effectively blinds the Defel. Defel can wear special sight visors which block out all other light waves, allowing them to see, but if a Defel loses its visor, the difficulty of any task involving sight is increased by one level.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > **Reputation:** Defels are considered to be a myth by most of the galaxy - therefore, when they are encountered, they are often thought to be supernatural beings. Most Defel in the galaxy enjoy taking advantage of this perception.
> 
> > **Overconfidence:** Most Defel are comfortable knowing that, if they wish to hide, no one will be able to spot them. They often ignore surveillance equipment and characters who might have special perception abilities when they should not.
