**TWO SKILL LISTS:**

The first skill list offered is the Hyperspace D6 skill list. Use this if you want a simpler, straightforward experience at the cost of losing out on customization and precision tweaks to your character's skill development. Using this skill list, you may only invest whole D6s into skills when choosing or upgrading. This list has 30 skills.

The second skill list is more complex, using davepac's redone 2EREUP skill list, which has reduced 2E's 140~ skills to only 49. Use this skill list if you want to be able to divide D6s into pips and to select Specializations. A number of Specializations are listed under each skill.
