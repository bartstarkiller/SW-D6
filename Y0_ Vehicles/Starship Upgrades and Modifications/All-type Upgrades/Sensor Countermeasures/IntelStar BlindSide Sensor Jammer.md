**Game Notes:**
> Any ship can use their sensor array to jam, this jammer uses a ship’s transmitters to flood sensors frequencies with static. A ship being jammed must make an opposed sensors roll against the jamming ship’s sensor operator. The jamming ship adds its sensor dice to the jamming roll, using the standard sensor arcs, in active modes only.
