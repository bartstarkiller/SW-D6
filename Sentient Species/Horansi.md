**Special Abilities:**
**Sneak Bonus:** At the time of character creation only, Mashi Horansi receive 2D for every 1D in skill dice they place in sneak; they may still only place a maximum of 2D in sneak (2D in beginning skill die would get them 4D in sneak). 
**Keen Senses:** Mashi Horansi are used to nighttime activity and rely more on their sense of smell, hearing, taste, and touch than sight. They suffer no Perception penalties in darkness.
**Story Factors**
**Nocturnal:** Mashi Horansi are notcurnal. While they gain no special advantages as a race, their life-long experience with night time conditions gives them the special abilities noted above.
