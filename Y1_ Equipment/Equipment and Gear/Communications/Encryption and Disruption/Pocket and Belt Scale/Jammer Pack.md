**Game Notes:** 
> To successfully activate the jammer pack requires a **Moderate** communications roll. If successful, it produces high-gain white noise on all communications bandwidths, preventing any comlink transmission within a 150-meter radius. A successful **Difficult** communications roll is necessary to tie the jammer pack into an integrated communications network (such as the comlink system in Imperial Palace on Coruscant). If completed, the jammer pack produces communications-fouling noise that is broadcast throughout the entire system, completely shutting down the network. The jammer pack can tie into an integrated network from any public access terminal, but this normally requires several additional computer programming/repair totals to successfully slice into the network’s management program routines.
