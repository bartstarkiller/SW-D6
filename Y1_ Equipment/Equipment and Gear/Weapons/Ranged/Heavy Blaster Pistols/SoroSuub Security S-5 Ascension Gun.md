> 
> **Game Notes:** 
> This weapon can fire normal heavy blast charges, poisoned microdarts, or a length of liquid cable. 
> 
> Microdarts inflict no damage, but if used against an unarmored target (or an unarmored portion of a target, see the rules for called shots on page 91 of the Rulebook), they inject a paralyzing poison. The target of such an attack must succeed at a Moderate Strength check or be paralyzed and unable to move for 2D minutes. The liquid cable can be used to scale walls (in conjunction with a grappling hook attachment), or can be used to ensnare an opponent. If a hit his scored with the cable, roll 4D “damage” against the target’s Dexterity rating with the following results:
> 
> **0-3:**  Grazed, -2 pips to Dexterity until freed, Very Easy Strength check to break free; 
> 
> **4-8**: Lightly entangled, -1D to Dexterity until freed, Easy Strength check to break free; 
> 
> **9- 12**: Heavily entangled, -2D to Dexterity until freed, Moderate Strength check to break free; 
> 
> **13-15**: Severely entangled, -3D to Dexterity until freed, Very Difficult Strength check to break free; 
> 
> **16+**: Completely entangled, cannot perform any actions, Heroic Strength check to break free.
