**Game Notes:** 
> Character must make an **Easy** computer programming/repair roll to prepare the spike. If roll succeeds, the program can be slotted into the computer system to be raided. If the roll fails, the spike is ruined. The player then rolls the spike’s die code against the difficulty number of the information. Use the computer programming/ repair guidelines on page 63 of the Rulebook to determine the difficulty. A spike can only be used once.
