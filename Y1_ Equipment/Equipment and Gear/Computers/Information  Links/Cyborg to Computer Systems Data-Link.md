**Game Notes:** 
> Cyborgs can make computer programming rolls or give simple commands. At-Computer Link is linked to a specific computer, but extra computers may be added. Cyborgs can only manipulate simple operations on a ship, such as things that a computer normally handles by itself. Air locks can be opened, grappling hooks deployed or released. Piloting and gunnery are far to sophisticated operations to be run through the computer system.
