## Overview

**Vulptereens** were a sentient species native to Vulpter that had a shovel-like mouth with six tusks, a feeler on their snout, and two pointed ears.

## Biology and Appearance

Vulptereens had six tusks protruding outward from their snouts, a feeler on their snout, and two pointed ears on top. Their eyes were yellow-green, with black pupils capable of seeing in dark conditions, yet they lacked good depth perception. This resulted in the use of echolocation in these conditions.

The species' two arms ended in clawed hands, that if dismembered could result in aphasia since they lacked a central brain. However, they were quite hardy when exposed to a variety of environments and did not succumb to toxic conditions.

## Society and Culture

Vulptereen are known for their advanced repulsor- engine industry. Vulptereens make excellent pilots and are good with their hands, but they suffer cultural gaps with the rest of the galaxy due to their isolation.

## History

The Vulptereen were native to the planet of Vulpter, a world that once contained a thriving ecosystem. The Vulptereen, however, transformed their verdant homeworld into a wasteland due to their over-industrialization.

Sometime between 20,000 BBY and 15,000 BBY, the Vulptereens were discovered by the Galactic Republic, and joined the rest of the galactic community.

However, the Trade Federation seized control of Vulpter around 32 BBY, which allowed the Neimoidians to exploit the Vulptereens. They forced them to drill tunnels that could be used as storage for the Trade Federation, and dumped the products that they could not sell on the planet.

Viper Sensor Intelligence Systems (VSIS) was a Vulptereen corporation specializing in sensor technology that experienced a hostile takeover at the hands of Arakyd Industries. VSIS researched and developed technology was integrated into Arakyd's highly successful Viper Probe Droid.
