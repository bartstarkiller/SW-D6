## Overview

Phindians were a reptilian species distinguished by their long arms and elongated skulls. Phindians evolved in the forests and jungles of Phindar, in the Mandalore sector of the Outer Rim Territories.  They were cautious by nature and generally preferred to avoid trouble. 

## Biology and Appearance

Phindians were gangly, mournful-looking reptilian species with arms stretching past their knees. They stood 1.7 meters tall on average. They had dark skin in shades of green or brown, sometimes with white blotches, and white circles around yellow or golden eyes. 

## Society and Culture

Phindians were known for certain cultural attitudes which many offworlders found annoying.  Blinking rapidly was the Phindian version of a wide smile. They were often hesitant about risking their life, even for a good cause. In conversation, they were fond of exaggeration, sarcasm, and talking for sheer enjoyment while avoiding the central issue of a discussion. These tendencies were, however, tempered by a sincere affection for their family and friends. When parting from a friend, they would embrace three times: once in sorrow for the parting, once in joy for the continuing friendship, and once in hope that the two friends would reunite in the future.

## History

For most of the latter centuries of the Galactic Republic, Phindar was ruled by a criminal organization called the Syndicat. This organization controlled the Phindian people by seizing control of all of Phindar's imports and exports. Any dissenters had their minds erased in a process called "renewal", similar to the memory wipes applied to droids. Renewed Phindians would sometimes be dumped on other planets, so Syndicat members could bet on how long they would survive. In 44 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi joined with Phindian rebels (including the brothers Guerra and Paxxi Derida) and freed the Phindians from Syndicat rule, allowing the Phindians to hold democratic elections for the first time in centuries. One of their first acts was to outlaw renewal technology.

The anthropologist Karke was a Phindian, as was Osi Sobeck, the insane warden of the Separatist prison, the Citadel. During a rescue mission to break out Jedi Master Even Piell, Sobeck pursued the rescuers and the escapees until he was subsequently killed. Moralo Eval was a Phindian criminal who killed his mother when he got bored. He plotted to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Republic with Count Dooku of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Their plan was ultimately foiled by the Jedi, who sent Obi-Wan Kenobi to infiltrate Eval's group.

The Phindian Moralo Eval was the criminal mastermind behind the Box

A Phindian was the administrator of the Phindar tanker facility. In 14 BBY, the Imperial Moff Wilhuff Tarkin came to refuel his corvette and talked to the Phindian. Hem was a Phindian senator and husband of the Phindian Teeyr Hem. Arihnda Pryce gained access to them by buying them an expensive bottle of wine. A Phindian was part of a crowd that began bullying several Imperial officers. A Phindian was among the patrons at a cantina on Son-tuul, when a collective of bounty hunters met up for a heist.
