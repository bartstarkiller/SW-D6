> **Game Notes:** 
> **+3D physical**, **+1D energy**, **-1D+2 Dexterity**. A m’uhk’gfa consists of metal plates bound by thick leather straps. A high, segmented collar protects the neck, thick plates surround the torso, while the heaviest plates adorn the shoulders. Thinner sheets are strapped to the arms, and a heavy helmet, usually bearing oversized prongs that sheath the wearer’s own horns, complete the set. Armor takes 4 rounds to put on and 2 rounds to remove (double that time if the wearer does not have assistance).
