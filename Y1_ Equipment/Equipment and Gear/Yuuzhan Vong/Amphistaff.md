> **Game Notes:** 
> The amphistaff is an organic weapon used by the Yuuzhan Vong. If used by someone familiar with its various functions, the amphistaff can be used as a quarterstaff, a two-headed spear (**adds +1D to all parry rolls**), a whip (**adds +1D to attempts to disarm or entangle an opponent**; successful hits with the whip inject venom), or a whip-spear (which shares the qualities of both the whip and the spear, though the granted bonuses are only +2 pips). In addition, the amphistaff can spit venom, or inject it with a successful whip hit that results in a damage result higher than Stunned. Either way, a victim affected by amphistaff venom must succeed at a Very Difficult Strength check. If injected, the poison reduces the victim’s Dexterity score by 1D (cumulatively). If the poison is sprayed into a victim’s eyes, blindness results. The effects last until the venom is treated. Statistics for amphistaff weapons are listed below:
