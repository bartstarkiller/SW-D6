**Special Skills**
**Vibration Detection:** Aganof use this skill to detect ground vibrations and determine the proximity of creatures and
beings around them. The difficulty depends on the distance and type of vibration: They can also detect air vibrations, such as temperature change and movement, and thus can sometimes detect approaching flying creatures, or even sense incoming projectiles and dodge them. Aganof also use their hard shells and this skill for “speech” through ground vibrations, as naturally as humans use their mouths and sense of hearing for speech.

**Special Abilities**
**Blind and Deaf:** Aganof cannot see in the way that humans can; they also cannot hear in the traditional sense, but they can detect intense air vibrations. Their prime extrenal sense is touch and a sensitivity to ground vibrations. By judging the intensity and frequency of vibrations, in combination with the type of surface they are standing on, they can detect creatures near them.
**Claws:** Aganof can use their claws to inflict STR+1D+2 damage.
