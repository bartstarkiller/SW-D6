Model: TranLang III communication module (modified)
Type: Modified droid and systems organic and electronic translation module
Cost: 1,500 credits (market version)
Availability: 2 (market version), modified Alliance Intel version is strictly illegal

**Game Notes:** 
> The modified unit uses pre-specified keywords in a specific language understood by the receiving agent (usually organic), so that any translator droid or opposed agent monitoring communications takes the exchange as simple conversation. The modification of a standard unit to the specifications above requires a **Difficult** droid programming roll, followed by a **Moderate** droid repair roll to install the unit without damaging the droid. Planting the droid in the desired locale afterwards is another matter.
