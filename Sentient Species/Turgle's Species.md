**Lacking an entry, here's Turgle's biography**

## Personality and Traits

Turgle was an enthusiastic individual who was known for getting into trouble. Despite his can-do attitude and innocent demeanor, many Koboh residents—including Dritus—were distrustful of Turgle. Doma Dendra had the most patience with him, and of all her many tasks, the most difficult was keeping Turgle alive. She believed his best trait was his ability to constantly hurt himself. Her first encounter with him was one of rescue—like Cal—saving him from a self-inflicted blunder. He was attached to her from that point on.

Turgle was also keen to share his stories, though the authenticity of his words was not always clear. At one time, he told Toa that he had named a road in Rambler's Reach Outpost after his foot. During a conversation with Zygg Soza in Pyloon’s, he referred to himself as a lover on the prowl.

Though he described himself as an outlaw, Turgle knew he did have what it took to be a fearless warrior. Instead, he believed that his key strength and advantage came from people underestimating him.

Despite not being native to Koboh, Turgle grew to love the planet and its many locations. He was the first to inform Kestis of the rooftop garden at Pyloon’s and intended to write a guide to the planet full of tips for Koboh visitors.

He also intended to use the planets natural resources and native species to his advantage in order to find his fortune. Some of his potential schemes included a rancor petting zoo, bottling Koboh matter to sell as a miracle cure, a nekko cheese venture, a collapsed mine escape room, and a roller mine roller derby. Talking to Moran, he stated he also had plans for a Koboh mud spa, a derelict ship ghost tour, and a cantina for Raiders. He was initially excited when the Mirialan told him to go to the Raider base and tell them of his plan before he was instructed to do the exact opposite.

Though he rarely let his status as an outcast slow him down, when he first arrived on Koboh he had a moment of reflection where he pondered his lifestyle of scamming and isolation. After he nearly died whilst out on an escapade, it made him think about his life. He told Moran that he did not want to die washed up and lonely on the edge of the galaxy, though Moran would not buy him a drink to celebrate his epiphany despite believing Turgle was a frog reborn.

## History

Turgle saw himself as a brave and fearless outlaw and would tell stories of his escapades to anyone who would listen - though many were embellished for dramatic purposes. He believed he was, at one point, the most infamous outlaw in the Outer Rim. According to himself, others called him the Prince of Pilfering, the Mayor of Misdemeanors, and the Sultan of Stealth amongst other titles. He would imagine what his life would be like after his fame and fortune had grown and would dream of owning multiple luxury homes across the galaxy having heard stories of Naboo’s lakes and Iego’s thousand moons.

Prior to 9 BBY, he found himself on Koboh after hiding undetected in a shipping crate and living in it for a long time. He told patrons of Pyloon’s Saloon that he was on the run after attempting to pull off the "heist of the century" and that every bounty hunter in the galaxy was after him. He was eventually discovered and taken in by Doma Dendra, who originally mistook him for trash and threw him away.

He spent most of his time on the planet in Pyloon’s Saloon. Following Greez Dritus’ purchase of the cantina, Turgle helped bartender droid M-6NK with the initial maintenance of the saloon by simply staying out of the way. He believed that Dritus’ management of the saloon was far better than the previous owners. However, his time in Pyloon’s led him to drinking which he believed bought him nothing but misery. One night, after too many drinks, Turgle confused one of the bigger members of the Bedlam Raiders with a dewback and attempted to mount him leading to him becoming mixed up with the gang.

Whilst on Koboh, Turgle found himself getting on the wrong side of many people and organizations. He owed a Zabrak gang a large amount of credits for an unknown incident he was involved in and had to convince himself not to run and start a new life again because of it. 

In 9 BBY, Turgle knowingly misinformed an Imperial officer that he knew of a secret priorite deposit on Koboh when, in fact, he did not. However, the officer paid him for the information and the two went searching for the deposit. After walking through the plains for hours, Turgle spotted something shiny in the distance. Thinking it to be the priorite deposit, the officer ran ahead only to discover it was a rancor shining against the Koboh sun. After the rancor left, Turgle stole the five credits from the officer's body and left.

He later attempted to sell useless scrap to a stormtrooper, but after his ruse was uncovered, he hit the trooper with the scrap and was immediately arrested. Whilst he was incarcerated, he found a shiny rock that he was sure that the same stormtrooper would be interested in buying.

Despite his desire to please, he got into trouble with the Gen’Dai Rayvis and the Bedlam Raiders frequently. At one point he was chased into a cave by the Raiders where he was forced to strike a dark bargain he would later come to regret. The Raiders ultimately decided to kill him after he traded them a High Republic tuner device that turned out to be fake. When the Raiders confronted Turgle at the Saloon, he was saved by Jedi Knight Cal Kestis, who had just arrived on Koboh to meet with Greez Dritus. Turgle felt indebted to the Jedi for saving his life and told Kestis a rumor about where he found the tuner tech, though he did ask to borrow it for exploration purposes -  a request that Kestis denied.

Turgle found himself in awe of the Jedi’s abilities and exploits, even attempting to put himself on par with Kestis. He believed a shell that he had found in Swindler’s Wash was comparable with Kestis taking out the Raiders. He stated that the symmetry, the hand feel, and the way it stayed cool in the Koboh heat calmed him. Kestis sarcastically, but kindly, warned him not to tell anyone else of his discovery so as not to make them jealous.

Following the Stinger Mantis crew returning to Koboh from Jedha to search for the intact Abyss compass, Turgle met them at the ship's landing pad and frantically informed Kestis that ZN-A4 had been "droidnapped". Upon hearing this, Dritus accused him of playing a part in the event. He pleaded his innocence and was enthused when it was confirmed that Kestis and Bode Akuna would be rescuing her together.

Despite the troubles that the planet was facing, Turgle had no intention of leaving. He believed that because he had been pushed around his whole life, no one ever took him seriously and he would use that to his advantage so that when the Empire let its guard down, he would strike. He proclaimed himself a proud Koboh local and his intention was to defend the planet against the Empire.
