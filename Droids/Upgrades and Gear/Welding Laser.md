**Game Notes:** 
> The HL welding laser is a small, versatile tool designed for ship-based repair efforts. The laser is small (5 cm long), attached to an external blaster power cell that can be strapped to a droid. The laser has a short range (3 centimeters) but is extremely powerful (**5D+2 damage**); the welding beam lasts for 10 rounds.
 If there is no power cell available, the laser can be powered for short periods of time by the droid’s own energy source; such a hook-up requires 1D rounds and a **Moderate** droid repair roll. The beam will last for 5 rounds if powered by the droid. If the droid attempts to run the beam for longer periods of time, it must make a **Moderate** stamina or **Strength** roll (whichever is higher); **if the droid fails the roll, it takes 2D damage each round until the beam is deactivated**. (Regardless, the beam will only last for a maximum of 10 rounds.)
