A civilian variant of the TIE/sr starfighter, the Scout-A was designed to be operated by a crew of one, but could carry three passengers, and carried enough consumables for a full year of operation. It had space to carry 150 metric tons of cargo in its 60 cubic meter hold. It was equipped with a Class 2 hyperdrive with a Class 15 backup hyperdrive, shields and a single laser cannon for defense. It featured a high-quality sensor array although it had a lower sensitivity than the military TIE/sr.

It was one of the first ships to use the revolutionary Twin Ion Engine design, with a cockpit and sublight engines strongly foreshadowing later Sienar craft. Many of the basic technologies used were identical to those used in the TIE starfighter line. However, its large passenger and cargo compartment made it much larger than those later starfighter designs, stretching it out to a length of 24 meters.

Unlike the TIE series, the Lone Scout-A was made available to, and widely used by, the civilian market. It was also used by the Imperial Survey Corps, and later, the New Republic Bureau of Scouting and Exploration Services.

Another variant, the Lone Scout A-2, was also produced. It had an improved backup hyperdrive and a new deep scan sensor array.
