> **Game Notes:** 
> Archaic lightsabers are attached to a belt- worn power pack by a cable, and weight about 3 kilograms. They are unwieldy and cumbersome compared to modern lightsabers, and the **difficulty of all Lightsaber skill rolls made to parry with them are increased by +5**. If an attacking character **misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points** (the base difficulty; not their opponentâ€™s parry total), the character **has injured themself** with the lightsaber.
