**Special Abilities**
**Protected Vision:** Firrerreos have nictitating membranes that protect their eyes. They suffer no adverse effects from sandstorms, small airborne debris, or similiar conditions. Their vision does not blur underwater; these membranes also protect their eyes from large bursts of light.

**Extraordinary Recuperation:** A Firrerreo heals naturally at twice the normal rate.

**Story Factors**
**Cultural Restrictions:** Firrerreo often keep their true names secret from all but their closest friends. They believe speaking a person’s name gives one power over that person. Thus, any speaker using command, persuade, con or bargain on a Firrerreo receives a 1D bonus to their roll if they use a Firrerreo’s true name.

The Firrerreos are a race of tall near-humans with striped hair and nictitating membranes that protect their eyes. Their skin is golden, and turns silver when scarred.
