**Game Notes:**
> Recorder images are processed through a special set of RTZ security filters, then recorded on a WORM chip so the data cannot be modified. The main image lens on the RecSys holorecorder has a fixed focus and only one focal length (depth of visual field, 1.1 to 3 meters), making it unusable for long-range surveillance.
