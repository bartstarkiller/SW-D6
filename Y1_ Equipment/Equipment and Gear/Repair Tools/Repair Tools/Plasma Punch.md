Cost: 5,000
Availability: 2, X
Damage: 6D

> **Game Notes:** 
> The Plasma Punch can be set to cut a circle from 3 centimeters to 3 meters in diameter. Given time, the Punch is able to cut through any material on the market, including quadranium and magnetically sealed hatches. It is very power consumptive, however; the unit can only be activated twice, for up to ten minutes each, before its batteries are drained. Recharges take 6 hours. The tool has a very limited range, 0-2 meters, and is impractical as a ship-to-ship weapon.
