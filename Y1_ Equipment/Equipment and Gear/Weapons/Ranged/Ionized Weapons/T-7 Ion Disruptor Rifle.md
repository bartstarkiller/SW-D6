**Background**
The T-7 ion disruptor rifle was a model of high-powered disruptor rifle designed to disable starships and take out multiple enemies at one time. The rifles would also have destructive effects when used on organic lifeforms. The rifles were responsible for the near-extinction of the Lasat species, and their destructive powers led the Imperial Senate to ban their use within the Galactic Empire. The rebel crew of the Ghost later stole a shipment of T-7 ion disruptors and destroyed them before they could fall into the hands of the Empire.

Few personal weapons possessed the destructive power and fearsome reputation as the T-7 ion disruptor; originally designed as an anti-air and anti-armor weapon, the T-7 let loose a burst of ionized plasma charged with enough energy to puncture starship hulls. In its intended role, the T-7 made short work of many armored vehicles, mechanized infantry, airspeeders, and even starships – its intense ionization being particularly deadly to aircraft, as it could shut down critical components and send them into a death spiral – the T-7 was capable of chewing through nearly anything its path. The T-7 was, however, a slow firing weapon and required a lengthy pause between shots to recharge and cool down. Further, the T-7 was resolutely unmodifiable, and could not benefit from attachments or modifications to grant faster firing speeds, improvements to its range, or grant multiple shots.

Despite its deadly fire capability, the T-7 gained its notorious reputation from its use on sentient beings; a single shot from a T-7 produced an explosive blast that could atomize entire groups of lifeforms – when used on an organic being, the victim was disintegrated on the molecular level atom by atom, resulting in a slow, painful, and excruciatingly grotesque death.
