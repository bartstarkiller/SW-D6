**Game Notes:** 
> This device, when worn, distorts the wearer’s voice until it cannot be recognized, even to a voice reader. It also creates as static “black field,” which generates a field of blackness over the wearer’s entire body. This makes the subject featureless to all eyes and sensors.
>  A shadowcloak grants a **+6D bonus to con: disguise skill checks made to conceal a character’s identity**. An opposed search roll can be attempted against the wearer’s con: disguise skill if an observer wishes to identify the subject. 
>  The downside is that the concealment field requires the user to be stationary for full effect. If walking the effect drops to **+3D **, and if running to only **+1D**. The device can maintain its black field for an hour, after which it must cool down and recharge for 4 hours.
