**Special Abilities**
> **Rush:** Nuknog can temporarily improve their agility, reflexes and speed. A rushing Nuknog gains a temporary +2D to Dexterity (and all related skills) and moves at twice the normal speed. While using this ability, the Nuknog cannot use skills that require patience and concentration, such as sneak or any Force Skill. A rush lasts for a number of rounds equal to 4+ the number before D in the character’s stamina. At the end of this duration, the Nuknog loses the benefits of the rush and suffers a –2 penalty to both Strength and Dexterity and must move slower than High Speed for a number of rounds equal to the charge’s duration.

> **Immediate Awareness:** A Nuknog's energized senses and focus in the present grants a +1D to all *search* rolls.

> **Struggling Foresight:** The cultural and biological bias for desire in the immediate present weaken a Nuknog's ability to plan for the future, often resulting in choices that achieve short term goals with longer term predicaments. Nuknogs recieve a -1D penalty for any roll that involves planning beyond the next few hours, rising to a -2D penalty if a wise decision is not a direct path to their goals.

## Biology and Appearance

The Nuknog were reptilian and humanoid in outward body structure. The Nuknog's bulbous head featured a ridge along the centerline of the skull. Individual Nuknog stood approximately 1.2 meters tall. Their legs were short and stocky, and their necks were long and stretched. They possessed small brains, but despite their diminished brain capacity, they were capable of delicate, complex technical tasks. They also had keen eyesight and acute hearing. A Nuknog could live to be 65 or older, provided they left the contaminated ecosystem of the homeworld; life expectancy was halved for those who remained.

## History
In approximately 1000 BBY, the Nuknog leadership sold their homeworld to a mining consortium in exchange for a support plan including employment, housing, and food. The employment eventually provided by the corporations in the consortium consisted of low-level mining and factory production jobs deemed too dangerous for company personnel. The company also provided cheap prefabricated barracks and meals made up of leftovers from other employees. The Nuknog labored diligently according to their agreement for centuries. Substandard mining equipment and nonexistent health care led to the deaths of untold thousands of Nuknog, but they continued on, insensible to the exploitative nature of the consortium.

It was not until a pair of Jedi visited the planet that the native population was made aware of their own plight. The Jedi reported to the Galactic Senate, which responded by quickly drafting legislation ordering the consortium to begin a program of reparations to the Nuknog, paying centuries' worth of lost wages and benefits. The corporations, deprived of their cheap labor and under the watchful eye of safety and health inspectors, dissolved soon after. The Nuknog were left poverty stricken and starving.

With their homeworld devastated by centuries of over-mining and pollution, and with no continuing support from the mining corporations to feed or clothe them, the Nuknog were left in dire straits. Public awareness of the situation on Sump prompted a massive relief effort from the Republic in the form of food and planetary rehabilitation. The Nuknog, however, had little interest in supporting themselves, demanding instead a perpetual supply of food and supplies to replace the support of the mining corporations. Nuknog leaders were suspicious of the Republic; some suspected them of being exploiters like the consortium, and others blamed them for wrongfully depriving them of their only livelihood. As time wore on, the sympathy of the Republic faded, relief efforts ceased, and the Nuknog's resentment only grew. By the time of the Clone Wars, the Nuknog were long forgotten by the Senate.

## Society and Culture
Nuknog suffered from an inability to take into account their long-term well-being. They focused on their short-term needs and desires and were, throughout their history, easily manipulated. Nuknog resented other races and harbored a deep grudge against the Republic, whom they blamed for most of their problems. Even after the dissolution of the mining consortium that kept their entire species in perpetual indentured servitude, many Nuknog bought their way off their homeworld by simply selling themselves into slavery.
%% you *SOLD YOURSLEF* into *SLAVERY?!?!?!?!* %%
Nuknog were impatient and possessed a unique ability to rush through complex tasks, entering a kind of trance of concentration.

Few Nuknog possessed the will, the drive, or the money to leave Sump. Some become slaves; others took up a life of crime. The podracer pilot Ark "Bumpy" Roose was a Nuknog, as was the Coruscant-based private detective Slyther Bushforb.

Common Nuknog names included Buhar Lod, Noop Warko, Po Nulnik, Skoo Runkin, and Vek Bolko.

**Slyther Bushforb** was a male Nuknog private investigator who worked on Coruscant, the galactic capital. Originally from Sump, Bushforb left that planet's swamps behind in order to live on Coruscant and work as a detective. He became quite skilled at his craft, accumulating resources and contacts, such as Dexter Jettster and Rednax. In 22 BBY, he was interviewed, briefly, by HoloNet News, on the subject of the "Baby Ludi" custody battle that was enthralling the populace.

In 22 BBY, a female Nuknog approached Bushforb with a case. The private investigator found her attractive but did not trust her at all. She identified herself as Vekka Lodik, agent to the star of the recent play _Airtaxi Driver_, Seboca. Lodik claimed that someone was attempting to kill Seboca, and she wanted Bushforb to find out who. The private investigator accepted the task, and set about his work quickly. Along with Rednax, he set up a meeting with **Seboca** at Dex's Diner, and shortly before the meeting Bushforb conversed with the Triffian Ony Bobissia. During the meeting, Seboca was irritated by the presence of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi in a nearby booth, but Bushforb was able to talk the actor into calming down. The rest of the meeting passed without incident, and Bushforb began chasing up leads immediately.

Kenobi had been talking to Jettster, but once the Jedi had left, Bushforb asked the Besalisk what he knew about the business with Seboca. Jettster imparted valuable intelligence to the Nuknog, and that in turn led him to a friend he had in the Bounty Hunters' Guild. That friend provided him with a solid lead, which then led him to a modest, unmaintained flat below Pom Plaza. The flat was registered to one "Manoca," another Dug. Rapidly entering the structure, Bushforb was met with the sight of Lodik training a blaster on him, and he realized that it was she who had been trying to assassinate Seboca.

Manoca was in fact merely an alias for Seboca, used to keep a low profile. It was Lodik's hope that he would return to his secret flat, in which event she would then kill him, and frame Bushforb for the murder. The Nuknog found the prospect considerably less attractive than the one offering it, and so he decided to turn the tables on the duplicitous agent. Making things easier for him was the fact that she was inexperienced with weapons, and so when she glanced away, he took the opportunity to draw his own weapon and shoot her dead on the spot.
