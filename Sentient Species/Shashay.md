If a Shashay wishes to go farther, he must make a Moderate stamina roll; for every three points by which the Shashay beats the difficulty number, he may glide another three meters that turn. Characters who fail the stamina roll are considered Stunned (as per combat) from exertion, as are characters who glide more than 25 meters. Stun results are in effect until the Shashay rests for 10 minutes.

## Overview

The **Shashay** were sentient avians indigenous to Crytal Nest. They were renowned for their natural skills as singers and astrogators, giving them the common nickname of **Space Singers**. They had a reputation for fiery tempers and a strong loyalty to their species.

In an attempt to prevent the Galactic Empire from plundering their home planet, the Shashay kept the planet's galactic coordinates secret—to the point of not trusting that information to navigation computers and instead relying only on a Shashay navigator's memory for astrogation. The Alliance to Restore the Republic, noticing that the Shashay disliked the Empire as much as they did, approached the Shashay and tried to convince them to join their faction, with partial success: The governing Nestmothers of the Shashay did not want a Rebel base in Crytal Nest until the Rebellion could demonstrate its might, but several Shashay navigators and pilots were assigned to Rebel starships.

Despite their dislike for the Empire, the Shashay still sent artists to perform in Imperial space. One of these was the cultural hero Crying Dawn Singer, who was kidnapped by Yearo Seville, a pirate who, following orders from the Empire, pretended to be a leader of the Alliance. The Empire hoped that the Shashay would reject the Alliance from that point on. The Alliance then sent a team to track Seville and rescue Crying Dawn Singer, only to discover a conspiracy among Imperial commanders.

## Biology and Appearance

The Shashay were sentient beings that had evolved from airborne birds. Although the Shashay kept the brightly colored, thick feathers and wings of their ancestors, they lost the ability to fly. Shashay could easily use the retractable feathers on their forewings to glide roughly ten meters for every five meters of vertical fall under standard gravitational and atmospheric conditions, although they could glide farther with physical exertion. Shashay had a feathered, five-fingered hand at the end of each wing, and three-toed talons that served as feet. While some Shashay had avian legs, each of them with a joint in its back, other Shashay had Human-like legs with a knee to the front.

With short legs and a height between 1.3 and 1.6 meters at adulthood, a Shashay walked slower than a Human and commonly was physically weaker. Like other avian species, Shashay were particularly susceptible to the high levels of pollution present on many civilized planets. The movements of a Shashay were considered graceful, and they had beaks and talons that they could use in melee combat.

Shashay had bird-like heads, with an eye on each side, a curved beak with nostrils, and a crest of feathers crowning their heads. Shashay vocal cords were complex when compared to those of other species. This allowed the Shashay to sing elaborate songs that were considered particularly beautiful and valued. At the same time, this same feature prevented the Shashay from speaking Galactic Basic Standard. They could understand that language, but could only speak their own tongue.

Despite their terrestrial nature, the Shashay brain was still adapted for flight, giving them an intuitive understanding of three-dimensional space and of the complexity of hyperspace. This served them well as astrogators and pilots, as they had no need to use advanced technology to calculate routes.

## Society and Culture

The Shashay were famous across the galaxy for their singing skills, their harmonious movements, and their fiery tempers. The Shashay were also known to distill Idlewil liquor.

Most Shashay lived on their native planet of Crytal Nest, in social units known as Nestclans. The planet was governed by a Shashay body known as the Nestmothers of the Shashay, which authorized individual Shashay requesting to go off-planet. However, the Nestmothers rarely allowed an individual Shashay to visit other planets, but nevertheless, most Shashay felt no need to leave Crytal Nest.

The Shashay had a strong community identity and loyalty to their own. They were known to protect, with their lives if needed, any information that the Shashay community considered secret, including the exact location of Crytal Nest.

## History

**Old Republic**
The Shashay were the sentient descendants of an airborne, non-sentient species. Even though their ancestors were fully capable of flight, the Shashay began to rely less and less on their wings as they evolved into an intelligent species. Eventually, as their wings became arms, their retractable "wing feathers" became useful only for gliding.

Although most Shashay had little interest in leaving their native planet, they nevertheless developed a space program and discovered space flight. While most species relied on astromech droids and navigation computers to calculate the coordinates for a hyperjump, the Shashay had a natural ability to do so and thus never needed that technology. While most Shashay remained with their Nestclans on Crytal Nest, Shashay navigators quietly roamed the hyperlanes of the Galactic Republic for many years, exploring and doing small-scale trading, but not drawing attention to themselves. They obtained certain natural resources, though not in large amounts, and carried out commerce with small colonies.

A small community of Shashay was found on Coruscant by 22 BBY, living in middle-class districts near industrial or public transit areas. These, like many other avian communities in the planetary capital, were prone to diseases due to pollution on the city-planet, as found by a study by Rhire Medical Academy. At the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, octuptarra droids carrying a pathogen that targeted clone troopers were part of a Confederate attack on Coruscant. After the battle, traces of the virus from destroyed droids mutated into a form that infected the Shashay and other avian species, leading to an outbreak of molting.
