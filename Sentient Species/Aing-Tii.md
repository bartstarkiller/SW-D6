**Hyperspacial Perception:** Aing-Tii have special talents which allow them to navigate a ship. They receive an additional +1D to any astrogation rolls in the Marcol Void and Kathol Outback, and an additional +2D to astrogation rolls in the Kathol Rift.
**Mute:** Aing-Tii do not speak, but communicate by flickering, touching, and tasting one another’s long, thin tongues.

**Secretive Monks:** Aing-Tee are extremely secretive, and the only example of the species that is remotely known to the outside galaxy are the wandering Force-sensitive Aing-Tee Monks.
