Game Notes: 
> Modulated broadcast relays extend broadcast and reception range to over 2,000 kilometers. Maximum range dependant on local conditions: inadequate communications outlets in outlying areas or extreme weather conditions can greatly hamper or eliminate communications capability.
> 
> The SW-95 uses an Aurebash keypad and viewscreen to send and recieve text based messages reliably across longer distances than audio communicators. Atmospheric disruptions will send partial messages at distances far beyond when audio comlinks become garbled gibberish.
