**Game Notes:**
> **Basic Suit:** Provides **+2D physical**, **+1D energy**, **-1D Dexterity** and related skills.

> **Optic Sensors:** Allows user to operate in complete darkness with no penalty.

> **Filter:** Self-sealing filter system screens out all dangerous particulates. Unlike stormtrooper armor, this armor lacks an oxygen supply; there must be a potentially breathable (but polluted) atmosphere to filter or the user will suffocate.

> **Comlink Scrambler:** Comlink is linked to other Coruscant Guard units and Coruscant Guard command, allowing units to disperse yet still be in full communication. Optional tracking beacon software adds a tracking beacon to that unit commander knows positions of other troops at all times; unit commander’s helmet has verbally activated internal “heads-up display” to show trooper positions.

> **Climate Control Body Glove:** Allows user to operate comfortably in exceptionally hot or cold climates for periods of up to several hours.
