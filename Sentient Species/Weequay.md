## Overview


**Weequays** were a sentient species from the planet Sriluur common throughout the galaxy. Weequay possessed tough, leathery skin resistant to desert environments and blaster fire. Many Weequay were mercenaries, pirates, and bodyguards for the Hutt Clan. Notable Weequays included Hondo Ohnaka, who led the Ohnaka Gang, and the Jedi Sora Bulq.

## Biology and Appearance

Weequay were a sentient species native to the desert world of Sriluur. Weequays were common throughout the galaxy. Evolving under merciless conditions, their tough, leathery skin helped them endure the harsh environment of their homeworld as well as providing natural resistance to blaster fire. This made Weequays ideal bodyguards and bounty hunters. Some Weequay grew horns on their lower jaw, while others had bumpy extensions of their skin. Weequays often kept their hair long. Weequays possessed the ability to communicate with other nearby Weequays through pheromones that were undetectable to non-Weequays. Weequays could also be Force-sensitive.

## Society and Culture

Weequays had the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language could not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses could even tell that two Weequay were communicating. Gotal were also able to sense their communications. Since each Weequay's pheromones were unique, Weequay had no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech was only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom spoke a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.

Only Weequay who had to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, took a personal name. Even then, some were simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity was much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survived, a single Weequay was expendable. This resulted in a sometimes brutal culture.

Male Weequay often tied their hair into long braids. Traditionally, they would grow one "seclusion braid" for each Sriluurian year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutt clans were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.

Weequay religion was complex, with many deities. Among them were the moon-god Quay and the thunder god Am-Shak. Quay was their chief god; indeed, "Weequay" translated to "Follower of Quay". Zealous Weequays performed ritual sacrifices in Quay's honor, at times resorting to murder, earning their culture a violent reputation. Each of their cities was centered around a shrine of black, polished stone, known as a _thal_, where the Weequay made offerings of food and valuables. Their religious code prohibited building _thal_ off Sriluur, so off-world devotees were obligated to substitute animal sacrifices (usually large animals like banthas).

The Weequays shared their homeworld with Houk colonists, though not enthusiastically. The two societies went to war on Sriluur in 10 BBY. The conflict ended after a decade, leaving many unemployed Weequay soldiers to find work as mercenaries and bounty hunters. This war also gave certain Weequay companies a good reputation throughout the galaxy as manufacturers of force pikes and other melee weapons.

## History

Many Weequays were involved in a series of wars against the Houk species. Many Weequays served the Hutt Clan as mercenaries, bodyguards, and slaves since the Hutts controlled their homeworld. Some were able to escape those hardships and sought out the Alliance to Restore the Republic and used their skill to bring some good to the galaxy.

During the Clone Wars, Hondo Ohnaka and his Ohnaka Gang became involved in several conflicts with both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The pirate gang operated out of Florrum but were extirpated by Separatist forces led by General Grievous. Ohnaka and his remaining pirates would work out of the ruins of the base afterward. When a portion of Ohnaka's pirates swore themselves to the ex-Sith Lord Maul sometime later, Ohnaka and his loyalist faction defended their ruined base until the gang reunified. During the Imperial Era, the gang would be dissolved but later resurface under the leadership of Captain Skragg.

During the New Republic Era, a Weequay pirate named Drell was part of the Warbird gang. Drell and the rest of the gang worked for the First Order until they were betrayed, to which the gang responded to by later working with the Resistance.

## In the Galaxy

Weequays were widely used throughout the galaxy as mercenaries or criminal henchmen. They played this role in their earliest recorded contact with the outside galaxy, when they joined Vodran/Legends"), Klatooinian, and Nikto mercenaries in the pay of the Hutts to battle Xim the Despot's forces at the Third Battle of Vontor during the Hutt–Xim conflict. Unlike the other races hired by the Hutts, the Weequay did not sign the Treaty of Vontor, and remained independent of the Hutts. They were used extensively as foot soldiers by the Hutt Cartel and Black Sun. Jabba Desilijic Tiure also employed several Weequay mercenaries, including Ak-Buz, the captain of the sail barge _Khetanna_, and Ak-rev, one of Jabba's bodyguards and an occasional drummer with the Max Rebo Band.

Weequay were occasionally hired as bodyguards in Hutt syndicates when they chose to make their lives in the galaxy. They generally went offworld as part of small groups, usually from the same clan. Their role in the galaxy was usually minor, as their mean-spirited temperaments left them ill-suited for more grand ventures, while their suspicious and xenophobic nature prevented them from carving permanent settlements on strange worlds.

Many Weequays displayed Force-sensitivity and became members of the Jedi Order. During the Clone Wars Weequay Jedi Knight Que-Mars Redath-Gom fought and died in the Battle of Geonosis, Jedi Master Kossex fought and died in the First Battle of Kamino and Jedi Master Tyr met his fate during the Battle of Thustra. A prominent and respected Jedi Master Sora Bulq betrayed the Jedi Order and became one of Count Dooku's Dark Acolytes, while another Jedi General named Sev") was killed during Order 66.
