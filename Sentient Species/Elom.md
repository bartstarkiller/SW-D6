**Special Skills**
**Perception Skills:**
**Cave Navigation:** Time to use: one round. The Eloms use this skill to determine where they are within a cave network.
**Strength Skills:**
**Digging:** Time to use: one round. This skill allows the Eloms to use their claws to dig through soil. As a guideline, digging a hole takes a time (in minutes) equal to the difficulty number.

**Special Abilities**
**Digging Claws:** Eloms use their powerful claws to dig through soil and soft rock, but rarely, if ever, use them in combat. They add +1D to climbing and digging rolls. They add +1D to damage, but increase the difficulty by one level if used in combat.
**Moisture Storage:** When in a situation when water supplies are critical, Elom characters should generate a stamina total. This number represents how long, in days, an Elom can go without water. For every hour of exhaustive physical activity the Elom participates in, subtract one day from the total.
**Low-Light Vision:** Elom gain +2D to search in dark conditions, but suffer 2D-4D stun damage if exposed to bright light.
