> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Olfactory Sense:** Orfites have a well-developed sense of smell. Add +2D to search when tracking someone by scent or when otherwise using their sense of smell. They can operate in darkness without any penalties. Due to poor eyesight, they suffer -2D to search, Perception and related combat skills when they cannot use scent. They also suffer a -2D penalty when attacking targets over 5 meters away.

> > **Light Gravity:** Orfites are native to Kidron, a light gravity world. When on standard gravity worlds, reduce their Move by -3. Without a power harness on such worlds, reduce their Strength and Dexterity by -1D (minimum of +2; they can still roll, hoping to get a “Wild Die” result).

(Surely, multi-layered or thick corrective lenses could offset the attacking penalty at minimum? Their stat block is devastating with little upside)

## Overview

The **Orfites** were sapients indigenous to Kidron. Due to Kidron's thin atmosphere, they had four large lungs in their cavernous chests. Orfites had broad noses with large nostrils and frilled olfactory lobes. Their skin had an orange cast, with fine red hair covering their scalps and trailing down their backs. Little dimorphism existed between the sexes, though females tended to have thick eyebrows. As their home world of Kidron had low gravity, most Orfites who ventured away from it required the assistance of a power harness for normal movement and comfort.

Orfite society revolved around the sense of smell, their most powerfully-developed sense. They produced strong pheromones, and used them to distinguish among one another in the same way Humans distinguished faces. Orfites had a primitive society centered around a tribal gathering called a Sahh. Each Sahh had control over a vast tract of the Kidron jungle. They traded with off-worlders, and a small colony of refugees, through barter in native Kril meat.

The [[Orfa Olfactory Corporation]] was started through a co-op between several Sahhs—collectively referred to as the Council of Gordek—and off-world investors. It produced a scent mask apparatus, which consisted of a breath mask connected via small tube to a belt unit. The unit held a half-liter of water and was designed to accept small tablets, that it used to form the mask's inhalant. Though [[Orfite Scent Tablets]] were designed to create complex pheromone entertainments for Orfites, many intoxicant tablets have been produced that had made them popular across the Elrood sector.
