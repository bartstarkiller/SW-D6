**Special Abilities**
**Healing Tears:** Fosh have a unique healing fluid that is excreted from their tear ducts. It is more effective than even bacta, automatically reducing wound levels by one level (e.g. bringing Mortaly Wounded to Incapacitated). However, it only works well against cellular infections - larger wounds, such as blaster bolts, can only be stabilized for 1D hours. One dose will fill a standard applicator bottle. The fluid is absorbed into the bloodstream on contact with the skin.

**Story Factors**
**Hidden:** Most Fosh prefer to stay on their homeworld. Thus, as their population is small, they have a reputation for being secretive.

 A secretive, concealing species, Fosh are easily recognizable as being of avian descent. They have a light bone structure, feathered body, and reverse-jointed legs. Fosh are few in number, as they have tended to stay on their planet of origin and mind their own business. They are mostly unremarkable, save for one interesting observation: their tears are a powerful healing fluid, rivalling bacta in strength. This fluid evaporates quickly, however, making the possibility of artificially reproducing it quite slim.
