**Background**
The AB-75 bo-rifle was a model of bo-rifle manufactured by the Lasan-Malamut Firearms Corporation. Bo rifles had a long tradition in the Lasat culture and were used exclusively by the Lasan High Honor Guard. Since the destruction of Lasan by the Empire, bo-rifles were rarely seen anywhere in the galaxy. The rebel Garazeb Orrelios wielded a bo-rifle. They strongly resembled electrostaffs when in their extended state. ISB Agent Alexsandr Kallus used a similar J-19 bo-rifle, which he was given by a defeated foe during the Siege of Lasan.

The AB-75 bo-rifle was a multi-purpose weapon that weighed 19 kilograms and cost 900 credits.
