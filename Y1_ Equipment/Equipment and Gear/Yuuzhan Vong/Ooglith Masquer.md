**Game Notes:** 
> The ooglith masquer, similar to the ooglith cloaker, covers its userâ€™s body with a convincing disguise. Each masquer is engineered to mimic a specific species. When used, an ooglith masquer grants a Yuuzhan Vong a +3D bonus to his con: disguise skill roll. Just like the ooglith cloaker, the masquer is painful to wear, and inflicts 2D damage every time it is worn. It can also be removed by pressing a hidden organ.
