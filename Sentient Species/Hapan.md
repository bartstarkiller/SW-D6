**Language:** Hapans are taught the Hapan language from birth. Few are able to speak Basic, and those who can treat it as a second language.
**Attractiveness:** Hapan humans, both male and female, are extremely beautiful. Hapan males receive +1D bonus to any bargain, con, command, or persuasion rolls made against non-Hapan humans of the opposite sex.
