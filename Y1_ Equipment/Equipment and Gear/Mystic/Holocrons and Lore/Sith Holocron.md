**Game Notes:**
> These devices act as interactive stores of information, most often used to retain the secrets of Force powers for future generations. The creator of the Holocron essentially transfers a portion of his personality into the object, and this sentient presence is then referred to as the gatekeeper of that Holcoron. Using special organic crystalline components, the device can reproduce light and sound wave information. Each Holocron focus on different aspects of Sith lore and powers.
