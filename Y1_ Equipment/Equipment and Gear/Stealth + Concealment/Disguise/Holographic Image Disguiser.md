**Game Notes:**
> This small unit can be worn on a belt and projects an holographic image over an existing real world object or living creature. Its memory capacity can store only a single holographic image and it can operate for 2 minutes before recharging, though itâ€™s possible to hook it up to a larger power supply. The holoprojection is almost perfect and even moves as the item or person shrouded moves. It takes a **Difficult** search roll to detect a fake, though **sensors, cameras and droids get a +2D bonus to detect** it.
