## Overview

**Umbarans**, culturally known as the **Shadow People**, resided on the dark world of Umbara deep within the Ghost Nebula. Umbarans could see in ultraviolet (below 300 nanometers) and had the ability to read, subtly influence, and sometimes control the will of others.

## Biology and Appearance

Umbarans spoke the language Umbarese which was written using the Umbaran alphabet. Umbarans were gaunt, frighteningly pale near-Humans with achromatic sunken eyes. Due to the Umbara's eternal twilight, their eyes were well adjusted to the dark, but they were easily disoriented when exposed to sudden bright flashes of light. The Umbaran militia, who took part in the battle of Umbara, wore airtight helmets that fed them a potent mixture of gases, which enabled Umbarans to be more effective in combat.



## Society and Culture

Umbarans were highly isolated and manipulative. A societal caste system promoted cultural goals of power and influence. Many had a darker sense of humor than the average Human, which would manifest in social interactions. Masters of misdirection, Umbarans almost never revealed their true thoughts or intentions.

Umbaran society was built on a finely detailed caste system comprising almost one hundred levels. Only those in the top ten caste levels were given the opportunity to leave their homeworld, explaining their rarity outside the Ghost Nebula. The primary ambition of the average Umbaran was to ascend through the caste levels, using tactics from blackmail and subterfuge to assassination, thus priming them for a life in politics. Failed plots to ascend the ranks of society were met harshly with the attempted perpetrator imprisoned and their family dropped to one of the lower caste levels. Dependent upon the rank of the targeted individual, the perpetrator risked a death sentence for themselves and their entire family. Successful maneuvering, however, was rewarded with prestige, making it worth the risk. They could also tell if a person was lying due to their more sensitive eyes and their ability to sense heat.

The highest caste level, known as Rootai, comprised a council that ruled Umbara, and its members were considered royalty. The Umbarans had their own military known as the Umbaran militia, which protected Umbara and the Umbarans from invasions.

## History

Umbarans had a presence in galactic affairs since the dawn of the Galactic Republic. Although few in number, they were always at the forefront of politics. During the time of the Galactic Republic, they strode eerily through the halls of power. Respected, yet feared for their ability to subtly sway others, Umbaran senators rarely met anyone foolish enough to call them an enemy.

It was a fallen Umbaran Jedi Master by the name of Phanius that touched off the first in a series of conflicts that eventually came to be known as the New Sith Wars. Nearly a millennium later, the Umbarans allied with the Brotherhood of Darkness against the Republic. An academy") to train Sith assassins was opened on Umbara. Umbaran shadow spies served the Sith on planets such as Ruusan.

During the waning years of the Old Republic, Umbarans used their natural mental sway to secure positions of power. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine selected an Umbaran by the name of Sly Moore to be his Staff Aide. Moore was entrusted with some of the soon-to-be Emperor's darker secrets.

During the Clone Wars, the Umbarans seceded to the Confederacy of Independent Systems following the murder of Umbaran Senator Mee Deechi.

During the Great Jedi Purge, Umbarans were used as spies and thought police, with a main objective of weeding out rogue Jedi who escaped the onslaught.

During the Galactic Civil War, Umbarans lead efforts to roots out anyone who is not loyal to Emperor. Their effectiveness leads even Emperor most dedicated followers grow to fear them, that strengthens the xenophobic sentiment among many of his closest advisors. They would help the Emperor find Rebel sympathizers hiding within the ranks of the Imperial government and military. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrunity-a resentment that grows every time they unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks.

Five years after the creation of Empire, the crime syndicate Haxion Brood was led by the Umbaran Sorc Tormo.

The death of the Emperor at the Battle of Endor caught many Umbarans by surprise. Even before the fall of the Empire, Umbarans had already begun their retreat from the galaxy. Fearing retribution from both the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic, the Umbarans fled civilized space back to the Ghost Nebula. With time, as memories of the Empire started to fade in the minds of the galaxy's beings, the Umbarans began to filter back into the galaxy, though in the low numbers typical of their off-world presence during the Old Republic.

Umbarans often wore Shadowcloaks").
