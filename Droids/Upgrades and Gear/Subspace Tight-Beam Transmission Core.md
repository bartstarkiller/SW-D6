**Game Notes:** 
> The subspace transmission core is one of the integral portions of an espionage unit’s secondary programming, for it relays the information to its planter. Upon receipt of a prearranged high-frequency signal, the droid downloads the information via the tight beam to the signal’s source. It takes a **Very Difficult** droid programming roll to detect an espionage droid, and the programmer must specifically state that he or she is searching for the secondary programming. Once the secondary programming is detected, it requires a **Moderate** droid programming roll to remove the chips without damaging the droid. The chips must be physically removed, as the espionage programming will withstand a normal memory wipe.
