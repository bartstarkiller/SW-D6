**Story Factors**
**Avoid Conflict:** Calibops are very averse to physical violence, and will seek a diplomatic solution whenever possible.

Calibops are a colorful avian species with massive wings that end in prehensile feathers, hailing from the planet Cali. mostly humanoid in build, Calibops have a bushy mane and a tail, appearing to be a cross between some sort of feline and a bird. A Calibopâ€™s wings are very powerful, and allow normal avian flight as opposed to simple gliding, something rarely found in sentient species of their size and build. Calibops are excellent diplomats, and are often skilled negotiators and heavily involved in politics. Derision directed at Calibops often calls them cowardly, as they will almost always seek nonviolent solutions to any problems. Unlike most other nonviolent species, Calibops can become very flustered, and have been known to have outbursts of emotion when frustrated. Their manes puff up and their tails lash from side to side when agitated, and though they seem to be in control of their emotions, they are as easily provoked as any other species.
