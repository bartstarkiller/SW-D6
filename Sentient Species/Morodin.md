**Special Abilities**
**Nutrient Slime:** The Morodins’ prime agent for implementing their biochemical agriculture is the nutrient slime secreted from a gland in their underbellies and spread in their path. Their slime - which changes in nutrient value depending on the Morodin’s diet - encourages growth and mutation of plant life.

**Biochemical Agriculture:** Morodins have extensive knowledge of Varonat’s plant life, and modify it through their own biological niche in Varonat’s ecosystem. By digesting certain plants and spreading their nutrient slime over other plants, Morodins produce new strains of plant food, some more nutritious than others.

**Story Factors**
**Hunted Species:** Because the Morodin have no established cities, farms or other signs of a civilization, they are mistaken for wild beasts and are often hunted.

%% Using these people as unwilling cows for the production of nutrient sticks as a byproduct of algae infused slime - no wonder those things are so cheap. I would be afraid of eating the many nutrient rich yet processing plant produced goods of the Star Wars universe- you never know what horrors may have gone into the treat you've ate. (Indeed, I shudder to think of Coruscant's Tubro Dogs) %%
