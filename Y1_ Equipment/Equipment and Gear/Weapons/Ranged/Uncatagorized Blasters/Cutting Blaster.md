> **Game Notes:** Produces a “cold blast”, a burst that lasts nearly a second and a half that can be used to cut down brush or even small trees, it is very unlikely to start a fire or throw sparks. The user suffers a -1D penalty to blaster due to the inaccuracy of the weapon. Weapon’s magazine requires nearly 4 hours to recharge off a typical ship’s power system, or 3 hours at a commercial recharger.
