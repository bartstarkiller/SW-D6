**Biology and Appearance**
The Makurth were sentient bipedal saurians, covered in green scales. Members of the species typically possessed four horns on their heads; two curled downwards from the top of their skull, while two curled upward from the sides of the cranium. They were nocturnal carnivores who bore savage-looking teeth. Makurth could produce a terrifying scream, which they uttered before entering combat, and they were prone to snorting and flaring their nostrils in order to intimidate opponents.

Native to Moltok, a planet of rainforests and volcanoes located in the Outer Rim Territories' Atrivis sector, the Makurth shared their homeworld with the Ho'Din, another reptilian species, who traveled the galaxy from at least 5000 BBY. The Makurth themselves were offworld by 1001 BBY, when one of their number, Fohargh, trained as a Sith apprentice at the Sith Academy") on Korriban. Only the strongest apprentices, those with the potential to become Sith Lords in the Brotherhood of Darkness, were trained there. While at the Academy, Fohargh dueled the Human apprentice Bane twice. In the first of these encounters, although Fohargh was at a height and weight disadvantage, he had badly beaten the Human, who had mistakenly assumed the nocturnal Makurth would be sluggish during the day. The second encounter was a more evenly matched fight, until the Makurth managed to disarm Bane. Taunting his opponent, he appeared to have the match won, until Bane used the Force to strangle the life out of the saurian. In later centuries, Makurth were frequently found as bodyguards in the criminal syndicate Black Sun.
