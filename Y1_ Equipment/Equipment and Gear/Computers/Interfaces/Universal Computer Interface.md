**Game Notes:**
> A computer programming/ repair roll is required for successful operation (difficulty varies based on how much the unknown computer system varies from standardized systems). A successful roll allows the user to add a +1D bonus to any subsequent computer programming/repair rolls using this system. This device will not override security programming in place nor will it permit otherwise unauthorized access to host systems. This unit does, however, provide for easy data transference between what might otherwise be incompatible system architectures.
