**Special Abilities**
**Amphibious:** Fluggrians are an amphibious species which are at home as much in the water as out of it. As a result, they receive a +2D bonus to swimming at the time of character creation only, and can also go without breathing air underwater for up to 4 hours.
**Neural Bundles:** Fluggrians possess special neural bundles, located at the front of their foreheads, which are able to process sensory information at incredible speeds. As such, all Fluggrians gain +1D to any reaction skill rolls.

A Fluggrian is easily recognizable by his thick- lipped mouth and a prominent forehead, which houses neural bundles that allow him to process sensory output quickly, even at high speeds, greatly increasing his reaction time. Fluggrian society is dominated by wide networks of organized crime, making them very suspicious of the galaxy at large.
