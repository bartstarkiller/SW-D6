> **Equipment Notes**
> **Biosensors:** These biosensors provide the droid with a +1D bonus to all search skill rolls as long as it is within 2 kilometers of one or more of them. Each sensor can operate for 3 hours before it runs out of power. If the droid deploys all biosensors, the internal space can be used as a 10 Kg storage space.
> 
> **Remote Sensor Platform:** When deployed, this allows the droid to make skill checks as if it were at the platformâ€™s location, as long as the droid is within 10 kilometers of the platform.
