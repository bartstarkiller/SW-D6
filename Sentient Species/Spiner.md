## Overview
**Spiners** were nearly-extinct bipedal sentient mammals with sharp quills. They were capable of hurling these with great speed and accuracy by flexing their muscles in a certain manner. Their native [world](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet/Legends "Planet/Legends"), [Worxer](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Worxer "Worxer"), was destroyed when its [sun](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star/Legends "Star/Legends") went [supernova](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova/Legends "Supernova/Legends"). The surviving population gradually became sterile for a lack of nutrients found exclusively in their home sector of [Elrood](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elrood_sector/Legends "Elrood sector/Legends").

## Biology and Appearance
Spiners were covered in stiff barbed quills, the longest of which grew on the arms and legs, and could reach a length of several [centimeters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Centimeter/Legends "Centimeter/Legends"). Spiners possessed the unique ability to propel these quills by simply flexing specific muscles, which could propel the quills with incredible speed and accuracy up to ten [meters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_standard_meter "Imperial standard meter") away.

Spiner quills themselves were extremely hard, as shown by [Hedji](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hedji "Hedji") when he attacked and killed a [High-hound](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/High-hound "High-hound"), as well as several [Cloud-Riders](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloud-Riders/Legends "Cloud-Riders/Legends")—lending to the quills' ability to pierce skin, clothing, and light [armor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Armor/Legends "Armor/Legends") with sufficient force as to [kill](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death/Legends "Death/Legends").

Spiners additionally had extremely quick metabolisms, and were capable of spontaneously growing more quills as needed; a Spiner could easily expend hundreds of quills during the course of a fight. Spiner names included Briss, Devik, Fifter, Firril, Jerrid, Meejen, Prikler, Toira, and Yaff.
