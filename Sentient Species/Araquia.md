**Special Abilities**
**Web Throwing:** Araquia throw their webs down on prey or opponents, entangling them and trapping them in this sticky “net,” which has a Strength of 5D. Once entangled, prey may be wrapped up into a bag and carried off. Web Gliding: After a supporting platform has been made from webbing, the Araquia may use it to glide upon the prevailing winds. Though they have minimal control, they cannot move the platform against the wind or make it soar higher (unless there is an updraft). When using the platform, the Araquia fill their bodies with air to make themselves lighter.

**Story Factors**
**Pacifism:** The Araquia are protectors of their forests, and they seek to educate others concerning the forests’ values. They discourage those who abuse the forests’ gifts from staying by confiscating or ruining their equipment. Killing or injuring except in self-defense or to eat are nearly as repugnant to the Araquia as harming their beloved woodlands.
