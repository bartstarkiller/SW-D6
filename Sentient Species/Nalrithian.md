> [!_2] 
> **Special Abilities**
> > **Body Armor:** Nalrithians have a chitinous outer skeleton  which provides them with +1D+1 protection from physical  damage.
> 
> > **Enhanced Senses:** Nalrithians have a very acute sense of smell. They receive a +1D bonus to Perception to notice smells and identify known scents. The gamemaster can make a secret check using Perception+2 to see if the character notices a scent, such as a familiar species or element, to the character.
> 
> > **Mindlink:** All Nalrithians share a special link with their eggmates, which makes them a limited hive society. Usually, eggmates work very closely together, sharing everything, including Force Points. Eggmates can share thoughts, experiences and Force Points voluntarily, or they can withhold them by making a Difficult Knowledge roll. If an eggmate tries to link to these hidden thoughts or take a Force Point, they must have physical contact and make a Knowledge roll with a higher result. Force Points gained this way can be saved for later use. Mindlink normally has a range of approximately 12 meters, though can be used over long distances (the mental equivalent of shouting). 
> 
> > **Resist Mind Control**: A side effect of their mindlink ability, Nalrithians have a +1D against any attempt to take control of their minds. If the Nalrithians are currently mindlinked, use the highest resistance among the group and add +1D per Nalrithian.
> 
> > **Telepathy:** Nalrithians communicate using a combination of scents and electromagnetic field manipulation. Devices that affect energy fields have no effect on Nalrithians, unless they are within 10 meters of the character. Generally, Nalrithians can only communicate with their own species and others who use scents and electromagnetic fields (such as [[Weequay]] and Jedi). Each species, however, usually has its own language, which must be learned as such.
> 
> **Story Factors**
> > **Xenophobia:** The Nalrithians are feared by many other species due to their close resemblance to insects. Average beings generally avoid Nalrithians because of their appearance. As a result, most Nalrithians are bitter toward all other species, often choosing not to associate with them. Nalrithians in general, neither trust nor are trusted.

**Additional Info from Stat Entry**
Nalrithians are an insectoid species from an unknown system in the Outer Rim Territories. Little information is available about their societies or customs. They do not speak their own language, but communicate telepathically among themselves. Although it is unknown whether Nalrithians have any gender, it is assumed that they resemble insects in that regard. Several Nalrithians share one egg before birth, and those eggmates have a special telepathic link that can allow them to share thoughts and memories.
