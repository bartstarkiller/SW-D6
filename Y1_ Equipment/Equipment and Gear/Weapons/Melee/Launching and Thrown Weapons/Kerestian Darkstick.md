> **Game Notes:** 
> When deactivated, a darkstick looks like a flat metal stick. When a button near one end is pushed, the weapon emits a beam of black light that warps at the midpoint, giving the deathstick its distinctive “V” shape. The black light cuts through any known material, much like a lightsaber. When thrown, the darkstick returns to its thrower whether it hits or misses its target. Catching back the weapon is an Easy Dexterity task. If the roll fails the weapon lands 2 meters away. If a “1” is rolled on the Wild Die, the thrower takes full damage. The darkstick takes a full round to be thrown and retrieved.
