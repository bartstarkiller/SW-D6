The tendrils are so sensitive that they can sense odors and pheromones, which can allow an observant Nautolan some idea of a targetâ€™s emotional state. Because of this, Nautolans gain a +1D bonus to all skills rolls involving interpersonal relations (ie, *bargain*, *command, con, intimidation, investigation*, or *persuasion*) when in water. When outside of water, this bonus is reduced to a mere +1 pip.

**Wookiepedia Entry**

## Overview 
Nautolans were amphibious, capable of breathing both air and water. They were known to be capable of surviving in extreme environments. Their skin could be green, blue, gray, purple, orange, or yellow, with red or green blood. One of their most notable features were their large, dark eyes, which were a product of evolution; through these eyes, they could spot details in lightless oceans.

Another notable detail were their long tendrils, which grew from their heads. These tendrils contained highly-sensitive olfactory receptors that were chemical-sensing, and most notably used to detect pheromones, allowing them to perceive expressions of emotion and other subtle changes in the body. Nautolans could translate pheromones emitted by other beings into an understanding of a being's emotional state. These head tresses could be severed, and while they were incapable of growing back, there were minimal long-term effects.

## Society and Culture

The Nautolans were known as a peaceful race, and disliked unnecessary violence. However, when forced to fight, they were skilled warriors. They had great respect for what they called the "ocean spirit," which they believed existed to maintain the balance of nature on Glee Anselm. Nautolan society was prosperous, and they were generous in sharing their resources with others. The species was most comfortable underwater, preferring to be immersed in liquid.

The Nautolan language, Nautila, involved the use of pheromones to communicate. These pheromones could be used to convey complex ideas, including full sentences and map coordinates. Nautolans had a cultural tradition moving their faces close together, placing one's cheeks next to another's cheeks, when saying goodbye.

## History 

Nautolans lived underwater on their home planet of Glee Anselm. The first members of their species lived simply in caves, but over thousands of years, their society spread to encompass large areas of the ocean floor. At first, the Nautolans coexisted peacefully with their neighbors, the Anselmi, but after some time the Anselmi grew jealous of the Nautolans and began to threaten them and encroach upon their territory. In response to this, the Queen of the Nautolans warned the Anselmi that their actions would anger the spirit of the ocean. The Anselmi recognized that continuing to threaten the Nautolans could lead to war, and so they moved out of Glee Anselm's ocean and onto a large landmass.

The Nautolans continued to send ambassadors to the Anselmi, warning them against upsetting the balance of nature, but their representatives were consistently sent away. Eventually, the Anselmi's desire to expand led them to build massive dams to hold back the ocean itself. According to Nautolan legend, this angered the ocean spirit so much that it brought down a storm to destroy the Anselmi empire and submerge it beneath the water. The Nautolans mourned that the Anselmi had not listened to their warnings, and continued to live peacefully, keeping in mind the importance of the natural balance.

Having gone beyond their homeworld by the High Republic Era, Nautolans could be found in many places in the galaxy. By this time, the land-dwelling Anselmi were very hostile towards the Nautolans, referring to them as "gill heads" and swearing that one day they would dominate them.
