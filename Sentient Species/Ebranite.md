**Frenzy:** When believing themselves to be in immediate danger, Ebranites often enter a frenzy in which they attack the perceived source of danger. They gain +1D to brawling or brawling parry. A frenzied Ebranite can be calmed by companions, with a **Moderate Persuasion** or **Command** check.
**Vision:** Ebranites can see in the infrared spectrum, allowing them to see in complete darkness provided there are heat sources.
**Thick Hide:** All Ebranites have a very thick hide, which gains them a +2 Strength bonus against physical damage.
**Rock Camouflage:** All Ebranites gain a +1D+2 bonus to sneak in rocky terrain due to their skin coloration and natural affinity for such places.
**Rock Climbing:** All Ebranites gain a +2D bonus to climbing in rough terrain such as mountains, canyons, and caves.

**Story Factors**
**Technology Distrust:** Most Ebranites have a general dislike and distrust for items of higher technology, prefering their simpler items. Some Ebranites, however, especially those in the service of the Alliance, are becoming quite adept at the use of high-tech items.
