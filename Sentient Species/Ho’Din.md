**Special Skills**
**Knowledge skills:**
**Ecology: Moltok.** Time to use: at least one hour. This specialization can only be acquired by characters (normally only Ho’Dins) who have spent at least 10 years on Moltok. This is the ability to recognize and identify the countless plants on Moltok.
**(A) First Aid: Ho’Din Herbal** **Medicines:** Must have first aid 5D. Time to use: at least one hour. This specialization can only be acquired by characters (normally only Ho’Dins) who have spent at least 10 years on Moltok. This specialization covers the ability to use Moltok’s various medicinal plants for healing and disease control. To determine the difficulty to make the correct medicines, the gamemaster should determine the difficulty. For example, healing a broken leg or arm would be an **Easy** to **Difficult** difficulty, curing a rash would be **Very Easy**, stopping a disease native to Moltok could range from **Very Easy** to **Heroic**, curing a disease not known on Moltok will probably be **Heroic**. The character then makes the skill roll to determine if the medicine is made properly the effects of the medicine depend upon the situation. For example, the medicine may cure the disease, allow the patient extra healing rolls, and/or give bonus dice to future healing rolls.

**Story Factors**
**Nature Worship:** The Ho’Din will go to great lengths to ensure the survival of the planet, considering the existence of plants to be more important than the existence of animal organisms.
