**Game Notes:** 
> Kavaavik are flightless birds used by the Yuuzhan Vong so that they can see in the dark. When worn, the creature inserts its “spinal needle” into the user’s optic nerve, allowing the user to effectively see in complete darkness at a range of up to 500 meters via echolocation. While wearing a kavaavik, the wearer is only able to perceive his surroundings as silhouettes, and cannot view datascreens, scrolls, etc. If the kavaavik is killed while being worn, its host is blinded for 1D rounds while his optic nerve adjusts.
