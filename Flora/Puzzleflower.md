The **Puzzleflower** was a complex plant native to Nimban with a symbiotic relationship to *bek'tovalis* bacteria. The Puzzleflower bloomed only during third spring on Nimban, collecting bitter pollen, spores, and seedheads on its multi-layered, vascular, sticky broad petals and irregular tubular floret-cores.  As third spring gave way to red summer, the moisture in puzzlepetals would retreat into the veins, curling the petals inwards while at the same time hardening into a calcinous bark structure.  

Within the cool protection of the Puzzleflower's carapace, the collected organic compounds of spring fermented. Toxic etioplasts were seperated from the enriching potion of pollen, spores, and seedheads, formed into a nutrient-rich viscous nectar by the *bek'tovalis* bacterium inside the flower's tubular cores. The nectar provided life-giving sustenance for the entire plant throughout the following eight seasons.

The toxic byproducts of *bek'tovalis* respiration had significantly lower viscosity than the life-sustaining nectar and flowed readily to the interior cavity's base. Puzzlepetal stomata exchanged moisture to the root system at the same rate as *bek'tovalis* byproducts were absorbed into the veins, hardening the Puzzleflower in direct relation to the amount and quality of nectar produced. This byproduct permeated the petals, coating the interior while also causing veins to become exceedingly brittle as the flower matured.

A mature puzzleflower's new chalklike petal interior resembled the caverns of a sponge while being as difficult to pierce from the outside as bone. If the outside was pierced from the broad part of a petal, the structure would rapidly disintegrate and spread concentrated toxins onto the disturber and into the plant itself, spoiling any nectar and leaving the *bek'tovalis* without a sanctuary climate to do their work. Each carapace presented a unique puzzle of overlapping, fused, and intertwined petals where only the removal of plates in a single correct order of dehydration could allow for the nectar inside to be released. 

The Nimbanel evolved early problem solving skills to survive the barren seasons in order to overcome plants like the puzzleflower's natural defenses. Though temperature control and stasis drilling techniques can now harvest puzzleflower nectar on an industrial level, the meditative deconstruction of a puzzleflower shell remains a staple of Nimbanel culture, challenges, and pride.
