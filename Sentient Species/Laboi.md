***Laboi two meters or less in length, then increases by 1D***
***for every 2 full meters of length, up to 5D+1 for the largest***
***Laboi (10 meters). Every two meters of length costs 1D.***

**Special Abilities**
**Teeth:** The teeth of the Laboi do damage equal to STR+2D.
**Fur:** Their fur protects Laboi from extremes of both cold and heat.
**Telekinesis:** Certain Laboi females can use their minds to move items weighing less than 5 Kg. They are limited to manipulating one item at a time (and cannot do anything else while doing this) and that item must stay within 10 meters of the Laboi. To compensate, Laboi females cannot grow more than 8 meters in length.

**Story Factors**
**Reputation:** Most members of the galaxy assume that if they
encounter a Laboi, they will be eaten, so they do one of two
things: run or attack.
