> **Game Notes:** 
> Resembling a Yuuzhan Vong eyeball, the plaeryin bol is typically used only by higher-ranking Yuuzhan Vong. The creature’s “pupil” is actually a tiny mouth which can spit a glob of venom up to ten meters at the Yuuzhan Vong’s command. Inserting a plaeryin bol requires that the user have an empty eye socket.
