*Game Notes:* 
> It is virtually impossible for a character using an Automap to get lost. As long as the device is linked to an orbiting source of data (such as a ship’s sensors or a weather satellite) the device relays accurate data regarding the user’s location, local weather conditions, other moving objects and navigational hazards. The link requires a Moderate computer programming/repair roll once per hour to maintain. The droid using the automap link can automatically display this information on a datapad (with a scomp-link) or project it on any on-board imaging systems it possesses.
