**Game Notes:** This is a small creature used to kill a victim through strangulation. When placed around a victimâ€™s neck, the tkun initiates an opposed grapple using its Strength rating of 4D+2. If the victim is restrained, she takes a -3D penalty to this opposed roll. Death from strangulation is the typical outcome. The victim can survive for her Strength die code (dropping pips) times five before taking suffocation damage. Suffocation damage is equal to 1D, plus 1D per round that the wearer is unable to breath.
