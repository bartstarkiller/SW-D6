> **Game Notes:** This weapon has a timer that allows the grenade to go off in any round up to 20 rounds after being set. The timer can be deactivated with a special code, or with a **Difficult** demolitions roll. The C-25 has a weak magnetic grapple that allows it to be secured on (but not tossed against) vehicles.

**Background**
The C-25 fragmentation grenade was an explosive device manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. consisting of a sphere of baradium-impregnated detonite encased in a conductive shell, which was itself housed within a cylinder that was activated with a twist. It was visually very similar to the Sonic Imploder.

The C-25 was used by the Galactic Empireâ€™s death troopers and coastal defender stormtroopers. During the Battle of Scarif, rebels Bodhi Rook and Baze Malbus were both killed by C-25 fragmentation grenades.
