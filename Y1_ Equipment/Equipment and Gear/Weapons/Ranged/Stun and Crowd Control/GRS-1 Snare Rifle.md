**Game Notes:** 
> A snare rifle fires a burst of shockstun mist, as well as a liquid spraynet. A character hit by this weapon is assumed to be effected by both attacks. The shockstun mist forces a character attempt a Difficult Strength roll. Failure indicates that the character is knocked unconscious for 5D minutes. In addition, the liquid spraynet covers a target, entangling him. A character thus ensnared suffers a <u>-1D</u> penalty to all attack rolls, a <u>-2D</u> penalty to his Dexterity score, and can only move at half of his Move score. The fibers of a spraynet are hard to break, and resist damage as if they have an effective **Strength** score of 4D+2.
