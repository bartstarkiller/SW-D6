Model: Qwohog Vocalizer Mask
Type: Alien vocabulator
Cost: 100
Availability: 3

**Game Notes:** 
> The mask converts sound waves and subtle movement of the wearer’s jaw into synthesized words and phrases, allowing Qwohog to converse on land. It’s programmed for one language only (usually Basic or Qwohog) but can be reprogrammed to synthesize words in a different language, with a Heroic computer programming/ repair roll. A non-Qwohog needs a **Very Difficult** Dexterity roll to operate the mask correctly.
