## Overview

"_Never trust a Siniteen. A brain that large contains a multitude of treacheries._"

â€•Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck

The **Siniteen** were a humanoid sentient species that were native to Mileva. They were able to calculate a hyperspace jump without the aid of a computer because of their levels of hyperintelligence. They had pale skin, pupilless eyes, oversized heads, and large and advanced brains able to perform these types of calculations. Bec Lawise, a member of the Separatist Senate, was a member of this species, as was the pirate Hal'Sted, the person responsible for taking Asajj Ventress away from the Nightsisters.

**Siniteen** were hyperintelligent humanoids, capable of calculating hyperspace jumps without the assistance of a navicomputer.
