Game Notes: 
> The Whisper is a highly illegal baffled realspace drive used on stealthy military starships. The Whisper allows a ship to move in space while running silent at a base speed of 2. Cautious movement is no more detectable than drifting; Cruise movement adds +5 to the sensor operatorâ€™s roll; High Speed adds +10; All-Out movement adds +15. 
> A WhisperThrust engine has a limited storage capacity for the necessary gases to move: enough to move 100 spacial units. An extra or replacement tank costs 7,000 credits. Synthesizing the necessary fuel requires 120 liters of pin-sealed tibanna gas and 2 kilos of high-grade hyperbarides and a standard power generator. The fuel- refining process takes roughly three standard days.
