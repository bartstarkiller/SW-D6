**Special Abilities**
**Claws:** Kolac have claws that add +2D to their climbing skill and cause STR+1D damage, but will only be used in defense.

**Story Factors**
**Humid Environment:** Kolac are arboreal creatures that eat leaves from trees that exist in humid environments due to their high water content. If the Kolac eats normal vegetable matter it must also consume extreme amounts of water. Their small bladders donâ€™t help either when they are in civilized environments.

**Pacifism:** Kolac will only fight to defend themselves or their companions. They will usually hide before defending.
