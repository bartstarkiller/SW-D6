**Game Notes:** 
> The food scanner itself has a 4D search to detect any chemical or biological toxins. If specially programmed with the owner’s unique biochemistry (allergies and the like), its skill goes to 7D. It produces a distinctive rhythmic vibration (detectable only by the wearer) when it detects a toxic substance. The wearer may make a Moderate cultures roll to seem inconspicuous when rejecting the poisoned food or drink.
