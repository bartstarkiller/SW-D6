## Overview

The **Ugnaughts** were porcine humanoids with slightly upturned noses from the planet Gentes. Compared to baseline Humans, their height would be considered short or dwarfed. Ugnaughts were industrious and loyal workers with a rich oral tradition. They were quite hardy, able to withstand long periods of discomfort, and lived around two hundred years.

## Biology and Appearance

Ugnaughts were diminutive, porcine humanoids who had pink skin, upturned noses, white hair, and thick layers of jowls. Some had tusks that they used in blood duels, They were strong and resilient, and their life-spans reached up to more than 200 standard years. Ugnaught children were knowns as "Ugletts." Members of the species who lived on Cloud City had a diet of genteslugs and various types of molds and fungi grown in dark, dank side tunnels off their main living areas. The Ugnaught's natural habitat was desert or wastelands.

## Society and Culture

Ugnaughts were ruled by elected _terend_ councils, which were led by elected _ufflor_ officers. They were also represented in the Cloud City's Parliament of Guilds. Ugnaughts lived in accordance with their "blood profession," with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts were known as _Ugletts_. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeded the number needed, a _blood duel_ was called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights were held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts were generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.

When greeting an Ugnaught, it was advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting "yaa-yaah" was considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurred, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements would be thrown one's way. The Ugnaughts divided themselves into a tribal hierarchy. They favored the color red, the presence of which tended to improve their work productivity. Accusing their work of malfunctioning was considered an insult among Ugnaughts. It was common for Ugnaughts to end a statement with the phrase "I have spoken" when making a declaration or announcing their mind was made up.

Alza'ran was a common name among Ugnaughts.

## History

Originally from the planet Gentes in the remote Anoat system, Ugnaughts were taken away from their homeworld as slaves long before the Imperial era. Entire tribes would often be sold into slavery. The remaining Ugnaughts lived on the planet's less-than-hospitable surface.

When the Corellian eccentric and noble Lord Ecclessis Figg wished to build a floating mining complex on Bespin, he decided to recruit several Ugnaught tribes to help in the mining of the base metals needed to build the structure. He bought the services of three Ugnaught tribes: the Botrut, the Isced, and the Irden.

He promised them freedom, livelihood and a share in the Figg & Associates profits. Once Cloud City was built, the noble Ecclessis Figg remembered his promise and gave them their freedom. To make themselves feel at home, the Ugnaughts constructed many labyrinthine and humid red-lit tunnels throughout the city, most of which could only be navigated by their kind.

In 32 BBY, some Ugnaughts worked at the Oovo IV maximum-security prison. When the facility was infiltrated by bounty hunter Jango Fett, he encountered these Ugnaughts while escaping the facility.

During the Clone Wars in 20 BBY, the Separatist General Grievous led an invasion of Gentes. His forces destroyed the Ugnaught Administration Hub and disabled the planet's defenses. He then took the entire Ugnaught population prisoner and put them to work in the Confederate droid foundries on Geonosis. Later he massacred the remaining Ugnaughts, except for some survivors who were later killed by General Grievous, when attempting to rescue a group of Padawans. A shipment of these Ugnaught slaves was rescued by the Jedi Treetower and the H.O.P.E. Squad on Yorn Skot.

Under the Human-centric Galactic Empire, the Ugnaught slavery continued, and they were used for many Imperial projects.

Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the Cloud City mining colony fell under the rule of Imperial Captain Hugo Treece, who enslaved the Ugnaughts. Many Ugnaughts fled the city, led by the wealthy King Ozz/Legends") who sheltered the refugees on floating platforms terraformed to mimic the original Ugnaught home world. There, King Ozz's Ugnaughts formed a resistance movement on Bespin, which planted bombs throughout the colony. As a result, Cloud City was evacuated until the bombs could be defused. When the New Republic recaptured Bespin, the Ugnaughts returned.
