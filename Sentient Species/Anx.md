**Special Abilities**
**Blindsight:** Anx have exceptionally poor eyesight, and instead use sense organs along their crests, knees, and elbows to “smell” the world around them. 
**Communication at a Distance:** Anx speak in a booming, low-frequency language that other Anx can hear up to five kilometers away. 
**Increased Hand-to-Hand Damage:** Due to their physiology, Anx characters add +1D to their Strength score when rolling their hand-to-hand damage.

**Story Factors**
**Fin Cloaks:** The skin and fins of an Anx change colors to reflect their emotions, making an Anx’s basic mood easy to decipher. As a result, Anx characters often wear fin cloaks that make it more difficult for others to interpret their emotions. An Anx without a fin cloak suffers a -2D penalty to all Bargain and Con skill checks.
