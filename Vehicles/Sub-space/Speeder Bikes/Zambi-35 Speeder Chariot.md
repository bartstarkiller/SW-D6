**Background**
The Mobquet Zambi-35 speeder chariot was a collapsible speeder bike manufactured by Mobquet Swoops and Speeders as a rugged but ultimately disposable mode of transportation. It consisted of two steering vane outriggers and a simple control yoke, and could be disassembled and put together easily in order to be stored in harsh conditions.
