> An Ossan who has left Ossan II within the last six months may have a Strength of up to 5D, but they lose 1 pip after they have been off-planet for longer than this.

**Story Factors**
> **Superiority:** Ossan feel they “know better” in any situation involving trade or barter. They sometimes do, but they can be taken advantage of fairly easily by anyone with a decent con.

> **Disposition**: Ossans tend to be foolish, but they are almost unfailingly cheerful and agreeable, a combination that accounts for their propensity to innocently create trouble.

## Overview

he **Ossan** were a mammalian species used and sold as slaves by the Ancient Houses of the Senex sector. Their homeworld was Ossel II, and they had sizable populations on Asmeru and Karfeddion, the latter being used by House Vandron as an Ossan breeding planet.

## Biology and Appearance

Ossan were canine-like humanoids with a stocky build, long arms, and short legs. Their faces were dominated by a pair of floppy ears and a long snout, with sharp, serrated teeth, ending in a single nostril. Their height ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 meters. 

## History

Ossan on their swampy high-gravity homeworld lived a primitive lifestyle, without even the technology of the bow and arrow. They were visited regularly by independent spacers trading for [[syp wood]]. Though many spacers would attempt to trade goods for syp, the Ossan insisted instead on exchanging wood for the chance to sign on as crewmembers. Though this usually meant that the Ossan would end up an indentured servant or slave, the Ossan believed this to be an excellent trade. Ossan fancied themselves clever negotiators, though this was usually not true. Many Ossan would be released from their contracts early due to ineptitude. These Ossan had few skills to offer other than their strength, and even that was short-lived as their muscles turned to fat in lower gravity environments. Ossan were the favored prey of the carnivorous cucul, a rough-skinned amphibious animal that resembled a fallen tree. Though not advanced enough to master a bow and arrow, Ossan did develop primitive spears in response to the threat of hungry cucul entering their villages.[1]
