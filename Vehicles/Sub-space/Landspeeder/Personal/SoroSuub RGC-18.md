**Background**
The RGC-18 landspeeder was a model of landspeeder manufactured by SoroSuub Corporation. Larger than typical landspeeder models, crime lord Cikatro Vizago and his thug droids made use of these, using their size and speed to make quick getaways and to transport heavy cargo. During attempts to infiltrate the factory, Ryder Azadi flew a modified RGC-18 to escape from the Imperial Armory Complex on Lothal. Like the RGC-16 airspeeder variant, this model included booster injectors in the repulsor engines, greatly increasing the speed it could achieve.
