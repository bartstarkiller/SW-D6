**Game Notes:** 
> To use the sensor blind, the operator must engage in an opposed roll with the operator of the scanning sensors. If the blind’s operator beats the opposing sensor operator by more than 5, then the scanner receives a false reading. In densely populated areas, give the blind’s operator a +1D bonus to his roll.
