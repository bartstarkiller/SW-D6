**Special Abilities**
**Piloting Bonus:** At the time of character creation, Iktotchi characters gain a +1D bonus to archaic starship piloting, capital ahip piloting, space transports, or starfighter piloting (choose one). In addition, they gain a +1D bonus to a related repair skill (archaic starship repair, capital ship repair, space transports repair, or starfighter repair, depending on which piloting skill was chosen).

**Story Factors**
**Precognition:** All Iktotchi have a limited form of precognition. Most Iktotchi are unable to control when these visions manifest, and generally receive them as vivid dreams or daydreams. Force sensitive Iktotchi who possess the Farseeing force power gain a +3D bonus on both Control and Sense rolls when using that power.
