## Overview

**Paiguns** were toadlike sapients indigenous to the planet [[Paigu]]. The Paigun body shape was similar to that of the Muuns, though they had knobby, scaly skin and were often more technologically apt. Paiguns were famous for their love of mathematics and logical thinking. They did not like fighting and preferred to let others fight for them. Many were talented engineers and mechanics. Some engineers, called "amptechs" had the duty of maintaining the massive lightning rods that powered major cities on their stormy homeworld.
