**Background**
The Justifier was a starship owned by the bounty hunter Cad Bane. It had a central thruster that was capable of reorienting itself laterally, so that it would align itself horizontally with the ship. When he acquired Omega as a bounty for Prime Minister Lama Su, Cad Bane went to Bora Vio located in the Lido system. After a fight with the bounty hunter Fennec Shand, Bane found his ship sabotaged and couldn’t pursue the Bad Batch.
