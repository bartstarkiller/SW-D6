> Game Notes: The Naboo royal pistols are custom-made, and not available to anyone but the Queen and her personal entourage. When used by the person for whom it was made, the pistol grants a **+1D** bonus to blaster skill rolls. The pistols are equipped with a short barrel and a long barrel. The short barrel makes the weapon easier to conceal, but hampers the range somewhat. It takes one action to switch barrels.
