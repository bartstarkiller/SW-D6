**Game Notes:** 
> This comlink is able to receive and send holographic images, it can even receive (though not send) HoloNet transmissions. 

> A unique feature is the ability to match a recorded holographic image with the sender’s live audio. When this feature is used, the sender’s visual image is replaced by a recorded hologram (of him or another person), which moves to match the sender’s speech. Detecting that the image does not exactly match the spoken message is a **Difficult** search task.
