> **Game Notes:** 
> The Sith Lanvarok is useable only as a ranged weapon. The disks launched from the lanvarok spread out, increasing the chances of a hit. This grants a 1D bonus to hit any target within 10 meters. Anyone using a lanvarok who also possesses the Telekinesis Force power can extend this bonus to the full range of the weapon with a successful use of that power. A lanvarok takes a full round to load.
