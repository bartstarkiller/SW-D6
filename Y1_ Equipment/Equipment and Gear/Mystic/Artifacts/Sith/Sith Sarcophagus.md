Availability: 4

**Game Notes:**
> If the Dark Side spirit is within ten meters of its Sarcophagus, Force-sensitive characters within ten meters must make **Moderate** control or willpower rolls or succumb to feelings of anger, fear, and aggression. If a character who has failed this roll attempts to call on the Force at any time within 24 hours, he will automatically call on the Dark Side. If any character finds himself laying inside a Sith sarcophagus for more than a single full round, he must make a **Moderate** willpower roll or be possessed by the Dark Side spirit. Transferring the essence of a living being into a Sith sarcophagus requires that one be custom built. The being creating the sarcophagus must have the Alchemy Force power and another living being to sacrifice. To complete the process, the Force user must successfully use the Transfer Life Force power. For every 100 lives that are willingly sacrificed, the difficulties on the use of the Transfer Life power are reduced by 1.
