Special Skills
**Gliding:** Time to use: On round. This is the skill used to glide

**Special Abilities**
**Temperature Sensitivity:** Gazaran are very sensitive to temperature. At temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius or less, reduce all actions by -1D. At a temperature of 25 degrees or less, the penalty goes to -2D, at 20 degrees the penalty is -3D and -4D at less than 15 degrees. At temperatures of less than 10 degrees, Gazaran go into hibernation; if a Gazaran remains in that temperature for more than 28 hours, he dies.

**Gliding:** Gazaran can glide. On standard-gravity worlds, they can glide up to 15 meters per round; on light-gravity worlds they can glide up to 30 meters per round and on heavy- gravity worlds, that distance is reduced to five meters.

**Story Factors**
**Superstitious:** Gazaran player characters should pick something they are very afraid of (the cold, the dark, strangers, spaceships, the color black, etc.).
