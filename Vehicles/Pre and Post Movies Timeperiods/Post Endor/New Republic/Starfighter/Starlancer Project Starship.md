> **Notes:** When three Starlancer Project Starships fire their Starlancer Cannons at a focusing ship and make a successful attack, the damage from their attacks is combined and redirected at a target of the focusing shipâ€™s choice, and the focusing ship takes no damage. Starlancer ships may fire at targets at and beyond sensor range when fed data from another source.
