## Overview
The mysterious [species](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Species/Legends "Species/Legends") whom the [University of Sanbra](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/University_of_Sanbra "University of Sanbra") [xenobiologists](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xenobiology "Xenobiology") called "the Diathim," otherwise known as "the Angels," seemed to be made of blazing [white](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Color/Legends "Color/Legends") light tinged with a yellow aura,[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) which suggested they were beings of pure energy.[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-FF30_2014-3) At any rate, their intense radiance made it difficult to make out their biological details. Most accounts depicted them as slender, 2 to 3 [meters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_standard_meter "Imperial standard meter") tall [feminine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gender/Legends "Gender/Legends") [anthropoids](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Humanoid/Legends "Humanoid/Legends") with six blade-shaped wings protruding from their backs.[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) One particular [individual](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim_refugee/Legends "Diathim refugee/Legends") appeared in front of [Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker/Legends "Anakin Skywalker/Legends") and [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi/Legends "Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends"), two [Human](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Human/Legends "Human/Legends") [Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi/Legends "Jedi/Legends"), as a tall woman of their species with wings, [milky](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Milk/Legends "Milk/Legends") white skin, blond [hair](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hair/Legends "Hair/Legends"), light blue [eyes](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eye/Legends "Eye/Legends"), a tiny [nose](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nose/Legends "Nose/Legends") and long [limbs](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Limb/Legends "Limb/Legends").[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Moon-1) Some other witnesses described the Angels as more androgynous, while many [non-Human](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alien/Legends "Alien/Legends") observers portrayed them as mysterious and fascinating variants of their own species. Whether their wings were physical or not, the Diathim could fly and glide freely.[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) They could even fly in the [vacuum](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum/Legends "Vacuum/Legends") of interplanetary [space](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Realspace/Legends "Realspace/Legends") without the assistance of a protective suit or life support. They also had natural [hypnotic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hypnosis "Hypnosis") abilities.[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-FF30_2014-3)

## Biology and Appearance

"_They were also supposed to be good and kind—two words you don't hear much on Tatooine._"

―Anakin Skywalker on the "Angels"[[6]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-EP1J/AS-6)

The Diathim gave off an aura of kindness,[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) and they were consistently described as benevolent by those spacers who propagated the legend of the Angels.[[6]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-EP1J/AS-6) They described themselves as a peaceful people.[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Moon-1) However, the Diathim were fascinated by [spacecrafts](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Starship/Legends "Starship/Legends"), which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their [homeworlds](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Homeworld/Legends "Homeworld/Legends"), [Iego](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Iego/Legends "Iego/Legends") and [Millius Prime](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Millius_Prime/Legends "Millius Prime/Legends").[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-FF30_2014-3) Because of their hypnotic abilities, those curious Diathim had a tendency to provoke accidents, causing the mesmerized observers to plunge their vessels into violent crash-landings.[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) For those reasons, they were still regarded as dangerous entities.[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-FF30_2014-3)

Since the Diathim were only seen when they gathered in flocks to welcome arriving ships, knowledge of what their habitat looked like remained hidden to outsiders. Although they had no apparent [language](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Language/Legends "Language/Legends") of their own,[[2]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-GORW-2) at least some of them were capable of speaking [Galactic Basic Standard](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Basic_Standard/Legends "Galactic Basic Standard/Legends"),[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Moon-1) the common language of [the galaxy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy/Legends "The galaxy/Legends").[[7]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-SW_RPG-7)

## History

"_We were a peaceful people before the Separatists drove us from our homes and stole our moon._"

―A Diathim refugee, to Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Moon-1)

The Diathim evolved in the [Outer Rim Territories](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim_Territories/Legends "Outer Rim Territories/Legends"), on the [planet](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet/Legends "Planet/Legends") of Iego and the largest of its [forty-two moons](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Moons_of_Iego/Legends "Moons of Iego/Legends"), Millius Prime. They shared those worlds with the [Maelibi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maelibus "Maelibus"), a species of three-meter tall burrowing beings who [fed](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diet/Legends "Diet/Legends") on castaways.[[3]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-FF30_2014-3) They were known in the wider [galaxy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy/Legends "The galaxy/Legends") as early as [25,793 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/25,793_BBY "25,793 BBY"),[[8]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Void-8) more than seven [centuries](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_century/Legends "Standard century/Legends") before the founding of the [Galactic Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic/Legends "Galactic Republic/Legends").[[9]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-TORE-9) At the time, the Basic idiom "space angel" referred to a selfless, innocent person.[[8]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Void-8)

Millennia later, during the [Clone Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars/Legends "Clone Wars/Legends"), some Diathim were driven from their home on Millius Prime when a [laser grid system](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/LaserWeb_Defense_Station/Legends "LaserWeb Defense Station/Legends") was installed there by the [Separatists](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems/Legends "Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends") to keep people from leaving. The [Jedi Knight](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight/Legends "Jedi Knight/Legends") Anakin Skywalker travelled to Iego with his [master](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master/Legends "Jedi Master/Legends") Obi-Wan Kenobi while on a [mission](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_to_Iego/Legends "Mission to Iego/Legends") to uncover a [root](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Reeksa/Legends "Reeksa/Legends") said to contain the antidote to the [Blue Shadow Virus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Shadow_Virus/Legends "Blue Shadow Virus/Legends"). The two encountered one of the Diathim refugees, and the Jedi eventually managed to deactivate the laser field, thus freeing the inhabitants of Iego.[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diathim/Legends#cite_note-Moon-1)
